# üêû CSS Challenge:  Dynamically Sized Card Grid with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a responsive card grid using Tailwind CSS. The grid should dynamically adjust the number of columns based on the screen size, ensuring optimal viewing experience on various devices.  We'll aim for a clean, modern aesthetic.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card grid will contain several cards, each displaying an image and a short title. The styling will leverage Tailwind's pre-built classes for efficient development. We'll use Tailwind's grid system to achieve the responsive layout, and ensure the cards are visually appealing and well-spaced.  The goal is to have a 3-column layout on large screens, a 2-column layout on medium screens, and a 1-column layout on small screens.

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto px-4 py-8`**: This centers the content and adds padding.
* **`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`**: This sets up the responsive grid.  `grid-cols-1` is the default, `md:grid-cols-2` applies to medium screens and larger, and `lg:grid-cols-3` applies to large screens and larger. `gap-6` adds spacing between the cards.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`**:  These classes style the individual cards with a white background, rounded corners, shadow, and padding.
*  The rest of the classes style the image and text within each card using Tailwind's utility classes.
