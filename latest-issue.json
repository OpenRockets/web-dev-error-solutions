[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this through clever use of shadows, transforms, and subtle color variations to create depth and a sense of realism.  This is a great exercise for solidifying your understanding of Tailwind's utility classes and how they can be combined to create complex layouts.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will feature a clean, modern design.  It will appear to be slightly elevated from the background, creating a 3D effect. We'll use a subtle gradient for the background to further enhance the depth. The text within the card will be well-spaced and easy to read.  The overall style aims for a minimalist, professional look.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>3D Card with Tailwind CSS</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg mx-auto my-10 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-200 to-purple-200\">\n  <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/400x200\" alt=\"Sunset in the mountains\">\n  <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n    <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Card Title</div>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
