**Description of the Error:**

A common MongoDB performance issue arises from having too many indexes. While indexes speed up queries, excessive indexes can significantly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because MongoDB needs to update every index every time a document is modified. This can lead to decreased application performance and increased latency, especially in high-write environments.  The symptoms might manifest as slow write speeds, increased database load, and general application sluggishness. MongoDB may also generate warnings in the logs related to high index maintenance overhead.

**Explanation:**

Indexes are crucial for efficient query performance, but there's a trade-off. Each index consumes disk space and adds overhead to write operations.  The more indexes you have, the greater this overhead.  A poorly planned indexing strategy might create many indexes that are rarely, or never, used, resulting in wasted resources and degraded performance.  The ideal number of indexes is application-specific and depends on query patterns. Too few indexes lead to slow queries; too many lead to slow write operations. Finding the right balance is key.


**Fixing Step-by-Step (Code & Explanation):**

This example focuses on identifying and removing underutilized indexes.  We'll use the `db.collection.stats()` command and the MongoDB shell to analyze index usage and then drop unnecessary indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Unused or Underutilized Indexes:**

First, we need to identify indexes that aren't contributing much to query performance. We'll do this by examining index usage statistics.  Replace `<your_collection>` with the name of your collection.

```javascript
db.<your_collection>.stats()
```

This command will return a JSON object with various collection statistics, including information about indexes. Look at the `indexSizes` field.  Indexes with very small sizes often indicate low usage.  Also consider the query patterns in your application.  If an index is not used in frequently executed queries, it's a candidate for removal.

**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified indexes to remove, use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.  Replace `<your_index_name>` with the name of the index you want to drop (you can find this in the output of `db.<your_collection>.stats()`).  For example, to drop an index named `myIndex`:

```javascript
db.<your_collection>.dropIndex("myIndex")
```

**Step 3: Monitor Performance:**

After dropping indexes, carefully monitor your application's performance.  Track write speeds and overall latency to ensure the changes have improved performance. You might use monitoring tools integrated with your database or application performance monitoring (APM) solutions.

**Step 4: Optimize Indexing Strategy (Proactive Approach):**

To prevent this problem in the future, design an optimized indexing strategy from the beginning. Consider these best practices:

* **Analyze Query Patterns:**  Identify frequently executed queries and create indexes that support them effectively.
* **Compound Indexes:**  Use compound indexes to support queries involving multiple fields.
* **Use the Right Index Types:** Choose the appropriate index type for your data and query patterns (e.g., hashed indexes, geospatial indexes).
* **Regularly Review Indexes:** Periodically review index usage and remove unnecessary ones.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Index Rebuilding:** If your indexes are heavily fragmented, rebuilding them might improve performance.
* **`$exists` Queries:** Be mindful of using `$exists` in your queries as they can hinder the use of indexes.
* **Background Indexing:** MongoDB's background index creation can help to minimize the impact of index creation on your application's performance.
