# üêû CSS Challenge:  3D-ish Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card element with a subtle 3D effect using Tailwind CSS.  The goal is to achieve a modern and clean look without relying on complex animations or JavaScript.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners.  We'll use box-shadow to simulate a slight lift from the background, creating the 3D illusion.  A gradient background will add a touch of visual interest.  Text will be clearly styled within the card, and we‚Äôll use Tailwind's responsive modifiers to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes.
