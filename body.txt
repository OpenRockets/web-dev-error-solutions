## Description of the Error

The "Too Many Open Cursors" error in MongoDB arises when a client application holds onto database cursors without closing them properly.  Each open cursor consumes resources on the MongoDB server.  If too many cursors remain open, the server eventually reaches its limit, resulting in this error and potentially impacting other operations. This is often seen in applications that iterate through large result sets inefficiently or forget to explicitly close cursors when finished.

## Fixing the "Too Many Open Cursors" Error: Step-by-Step Code Examples

This example demonstrates the problem and its solution using Python and the `pymongo` driver.  We'll assume you already have a connection to your MongoDB database established.


**Problematic Code (Python):**

```python
import pymongo

# Establish connection (replace with your connection string)
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# Retrieve a large number of documents
cursor = collection.find({})

# Incorrect approach: This keeps the cursor open indefinitely!
for document in cursor:
    # Process document...
    print(document)

# Connection should be closed explicitly, but cursor is still open
client.close() 
```

**Corrected Code (Python):**

```python
import pymongo

# Establish connection (replace with your connection string)
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# Retrieve a large number of documents
cursor = collection.find({})

# Correct approach: Iterate and explicitly close the cursor
try:
    for document in cursor:
        # Process document...
        print(document)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    cursor.close()  # Ensure the cursor is closed even if an error occurs
    client.close()
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

The crucial change is the addition of `cursor.close()` within a `finally` block.  This guarantees the cursor is closed, even if an exception occurs during the iteration.  The `finally` block ensures that cleanup actions are always executed, regardless of how the `try` block exits.  Always close your cursors explicitly to prevent resource leaks and the "Too Many Open Cursors" error.


## Explanation

The root cause is inefficient cursor management.  MongoDB allocates resources for each open cursor.  Applications that fail to close cursors after use accumulate these resources, leading to the server's resource exhaustion.  The fix involves diligently closing cursors using the appropriate methods provided by your MongoDB driver.  Using iterators (as shown in the corrected example) can also help ensure cursors are automatically closed when the iteration completes.
