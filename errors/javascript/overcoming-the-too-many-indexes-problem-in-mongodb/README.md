# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered in MongoDB, particularly in larger deployments, is having too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to several performance issues:

* **Write Performance Degradation:**  Each index needs to be updated every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  Too many indexes drastically slow down write operations.
* **Storage Space Consumption:** Indexes consume significant disk space.  Many indexes can bloat the database size and increase storage costs.
* **Query Planner Confusion:** The query optimizer might struggle to choose the optimal index among numerous options, leading to suboptimal query performance.

This issue often manifests as slow write operations and potentially slower reads if the query planner is overwhelmed.  Monitoring tools might show high write times and disk I/O activity.


## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code and Explanation)

This solution focuses on identifying and removing redundant or underutilized indexes.  We'll use the MongoDB shell for demonstration.

**Step 1: Identify Underutilized Indexes**

First, we need to identify which indexes are not contributing significantly to query performance.  The `db.collection.stats()` command provides basic index usage statistics, but a more detailed analysis may require profiling.  However, a good starting point is:

```javascript
db.collectionName.stats()
```

Replace `collectionName` with the name of your collection.  Look for indexes with low `accesses` compared to other indexes. This will indicate indexes rarely used.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Performance with Profiling**

For a more in-depth analysis, enable profiling:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2) //Enables slow query profiling
```

Run your application for a while to generate profiling data. Then examine the slow queries:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:100}}).sort({millis:-1})
```
This command shows queries that took more than 100 milliseconds. Examine these queries to see which indexes might be helping or hindering. You can identify patterns where indexes are missing or excessive indexes are causing a problem.

**Step 3: Remove Redundant or Unused Indexes**

Once you've identified underutilized or redundant indexes (for example, indexes covering the same fields with different orders or indexes that aren't used at all), use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove them.

```javascript
//Example: Drop index named "myIndex"
db.collectionName.dropIndex("myIndex") 

//Example: Drop index on field 'field1'
db.collectionName.dropIndex({field1:1})

//Example: Drop compound index
db.collectionName.dropIndex({field1:1, field2:-1})
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, closely monitor write and read operations to ensure performance has improved.  You might use MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's logging mechanisms for this.  If performance doesn't improve or degrades, you may need to reconsider your index strategy.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes creates a performance bottleneck during write operations because each index needs to be updated for every document change.  The overhead of maintaining numerous indexes can outweigh the benefits of faster query lookups.  Removing unused or redundant indexes minimizes this overhead, leading to faster writes and potentially faster reads if the query planner is less burdened.  Profiling helps identify the truly useful indexes by analyzing real-world query patterns.
