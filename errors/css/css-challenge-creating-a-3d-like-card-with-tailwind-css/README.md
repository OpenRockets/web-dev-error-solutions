# üêû CSS Challenge:  Creating a 3D-like Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a card with a subtle 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this using box-shadow and subtle transformations to simulate depth and perspective.  This is a beginner-friendly challenge, ideal for practicing Tailwind's utility-first approach.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, minimalist design.  It will feature a subtle drop shadow to give it a lifted appearance. We'll use a slightly larger `box-shadow` on hover to enhance the 3D effect.  The card will also include a simple title and a paragraph of text.  We'll leverage Tailwind's responsive design capabilities to ensure the card adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

**Full Code:**

<body class="bg-gray-100">
  <div class="container mx-auto p-8">
    <div class="max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition duration-300 transform hover:-translate-y-1">
      <div class="p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
          This is a sample paragraph of text for the card. You can add more content here as needed.  This demonstrates a basic 3D card effect using Tailwind CSS.

```


**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-8`:** Centers the card horizontally on the page and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card, ensuring responsiveness.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg`:**  Sets the background color to white and adds rounded corners.
* **`shadow-md hover:shadow-lg`:** Applies a medium shadow by default and a larger shadow on hover, creating the 3D effect.
* **`transition duration-300 transform hover:-translate-y-1`:** Adds a smooth transition for the hover effect, subtly lifting the card on hover.
* **`p-6`:** Adds padding to the content within the card.
* **`text-xl font-bold mb-2`:** Styles the title.
* **`text-gray-700 text-base`:** Styles the paragraph text.
