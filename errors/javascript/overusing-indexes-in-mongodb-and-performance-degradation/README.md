# üêû Overusing Indexes in MongoDB and Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries, creating too many or improperly designed indexes can lead to performance degradation.  This happens because writing operations (inserts, updates, deletes) become slower as MongoDB needs to update all affected indexes.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space and can lead to slower query planning times as the query optimizer needs to consider more options.  The symptom is often unexpectedly slow write operations and potentially slower reads if the query optimizer gets bogged down.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address over-indexing by analyzing slow query logs and optimizing index usage.

**Step 1: Identify Slow Queries**

Use the MongoDB profiler to identify slow queries.  Enable profiling:

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Level 2 profiles all queries
```

Let's assume you've identified a slow query like this:

```javascript
db.myCollection.find({ "field1": "value1", "field2": "value2" })
```


**Step 2: Analyze Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to examine existing indexes:

```javascript
db.myCollection.getIndexes()
```

You might see numerous indexes, some possibly redundant or unused.

**Step 3: Optimize Indexes**

Based on query patterns, we can optimize.  Suppose frequent queries filter on `field1` and `field2` together.  A compound index on `{"field1": 1, "field2": 1}` is ideal.   However, if many queries only use `field1`, a separate index on `{"field1": 1}` might be beneficial (though often a single compound index will be sufficient).

**Step 4: Remove Redundant Indexes**

If you find multiple indexes that cover the same query patterns, remove the redundant ones.  For instance, if you have indexes on `{"field1": 1}` and `{"field1": 1, "field2": 1}`, and most queries use only `field1`, dropping the compound index might improve write performance.  Use `db.collection.dropIndex()` to remove an index:

```javascript
db.myCollection.dropIndex("field1_1_field2_1") //Replace with actual index name from getIndexes()
```


**Step 5: Create Compound Indexes Strategically**

In our example,  if the majority of queries use both `field1` and `field2`, creating a single compound index is optimal.

```javascript
db.myCollection.createIndex( { "field1": 1, "field2": 1 } )
```


**Step 6: Monitor Performance**

After implementing changes, monitor performance using the profiler or other monitoring tools to ensure improvements.  Disable profiling once done:

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```


## Explanation

Over-indexing slows down write operations because every write requires updating all affected indexes.  The query optimizer also spends more time evaluating numerous index options, potentially slowing down query planning.  By strategically selecting and creating only necessary compound indexes, you minimize the number of index updates needed for writes and reduce the query optimizer's workload.
