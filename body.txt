This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing and modern card using Tailwind CSS. The card will feature an image, title, description, and a button, all styled with a clean and contemporary aesthetic. We'll leverage Tailwind's utility-first approach for rapid development and consistent styling.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, minimalist design. It will use a subtle shadow for depth, rounded corners, and a consistent color palette.  The image will be responsive and maintain aspect ratio. The text will be clearly legible with appropriate font sizes and weights. The button will have a distinct visual style that encourages interaction.


**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-white">
  <img class="w-full" src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Placeholder Image">
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Card Title</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">

**Explanation:**

* **`max-w-sm`:** This limits the card's maximum width to small size.
* **`rounded`:** Applies rounded corners.
* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card's boundaries.
* **`shadow-lg`:** Adds a large shadow for depth.
* **`bg-white`:** Sets the background color to white.
* **`w-full` (image):** Makes the image take up the full width of its container.
* **`px-6 py-4`:** Adds padding to the content area.
* **`font-bold text-xl mb-2`:** Styles the title with bold font, extra-large size, and bottom margin.
* **`text-gray-700 text-base`:** Styles the description text with gray color and base size.
* **`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700`:** Styles the button with blue background and a hover effect.
* **`text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`:**  Further styles the button with white text, bold font, padding, and rounded corners.
