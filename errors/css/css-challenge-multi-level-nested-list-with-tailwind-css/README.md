# üêû CSS Challenge:  Multi-Level Nested List with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves styling a multi-level nested list using Tailwind CSS to achieve a visually appealing and easily navigable hierarchy.  The goal is to clearly differentiate between the different levels of the list using appropriate spacing, indentation, and styling.  We'll avoid excessive use of inline styles, focusing instead on class-based styling with Tailwind's utility classes.

**Description of the Styling:**

The styling will use Tailwind's utility classes to create a visually distinct hierarchy.  We'll employ different margin and padding classes to control the indentation and spacing between list items at each level.  List markers will be styled, and potentially different font weights or colors will be used to further emphasize the nesting levels.

**Full Code:**

```html
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li class="mb-2">
    Level 1 Item 1
    <ul class="list-decimal ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2">Level 2 Item 1</li>
      <li class="mb-2">Level 2 Item 2
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li class="mb-2">Level 3 Item 1</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Level 3 Item 2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">Level 1 Item 2</li>
  <li class="mb-2">Level 1 Item 3
    <ul class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li class="mb-2">Level 2 Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

```


**Explanation:**

* **`list-disc` and `list-decimal`:** These classes control the list marker style (disc or decimal).
* **`ml-6`:** This adds margin to the left, creating the indentation for each nesting level.  The value `6` represents 6 units in Tailwind's spacing system (approximately 24px). You can adjust this value to change the indentation.
* **`mb-2`:** This adds margin to the bottom, creating spacing between list items.  Again, the value can be adjusted.


This approach provides a clean and maintainable way to style the nested list.  By leveraging Tailwind's pre-defined utility classes, we avoid writing custom CSS rules, reducing code complexity and improving maintainability.
