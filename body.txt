This document addresses a common problem developers encounter in MongoDB: having too many indexes on a collection.  While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can hinder performance due to increased write operations overhead and storage consumption.

## Description of the Error

The error isn't a specific error message but rather a performance degradation.  Symptoms include:

* **Slow write operations:**  Inserting, updating, and deleting documents become significantly slower.
* **Increased storage usage:**  Each index consumes disk space.  Too many indexes lead to excessive storage usage.
* **Query performance inconsistencies:** While some queries might be fast, others might become unexpectedly slow due to index contention.

This performance bottleneck isn't immediately obvious and often requires careful monitoring and profiling to identify.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example assumes a collection named `products` with numerous indexes, some of which are redundant or underutilized. We will use the MongoDB shell for demonstration.

**Step 1: Identify Redundant and Unused Indexes**

We begin by listing all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  Carefully review this list to identify indexes that:

* **Cover the same fields:**  Two indexes with similar key patterns might be redundant.
* **Are seldom used:** Check your application logs and MongoDB profiler to find which indexes are frequently used and which are rarely, if ever, utilized.  Indexes with low utilization are candidates for removal.

**Step 2: Remove Redundant Indexes**

Let's say you identify an index on `{"category": 1, "price": 1}` which is largely redundant with another index on `{"category": 1}`.  You can remove it with:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"category": 1, "price": 1})
```

**Step 3: Remove Unused Indexes**

If you identify an index on `{"description": 1}` that is never used in queries, you can remove it using:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"description": 1})
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor the performance of your write operations and queries. Use the MongoDB profiler to track query execution times and index usage.

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enables profiling at a level to capture all queries
// Perform operations to test the impact
db.getProfilingStatus() // Check profiling results
db.setProfilingLevel(0) // Disable profiling once done
```

**Step 5: Consider Compound Indexes Carefully**

When creating new compound indexes (indexes with multiple fields), ensure they cover the most frequently used query patterns. Creating overly broad compound indexes can negate their benefits.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes forces MongoDB to perform more write operations (updates, insertions, deletions) because it must update all indexes whenever a document is modified. This leads to write performance degradation.  Furthermore, the storage overhead increases linearly with the number of indexes.  Improper index selection and an excess of indexes overshadow the benefits of faster query times.
