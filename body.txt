This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card element using CSS, mimicking a 3D effect through the strategic use of box-shadows and subtle gradients.  We'll be using standard CSS (no frameworks like Tailwind for this example to showcase fundamental CSS techniques).

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, modern aesthetic.  It features:

* A subtle, light gradient background for depth.
* Multiple box-shadows to create a layered, 3D effect.  The shadows will be carefully positioned and blurred to avoid a harsh or unnatural look.
* Rounded corners for a softer appearance.
* Internal padding for content spacing.
* A contrasting text color for good readability.

**Full Code:**

```css
.card {
  width: 300px;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #f0f0f0, #e0e0e0);
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
              -5px -5px 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); /*Double shadow for 3D effect*/
  padding: 20px;
  color: #333;
}

.card h2 {
  margin-top: 0;
}

.card p {
  line-height: 1.6;
}
```

**HTML (Example usage):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>3D Card</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>My Awesome Card</h2>
    <p>This is a sample card created using CSS to demonstrate a 3D effect.  Notice the subtle gradients and shadows.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`linear-gradient(to bottom right, #f0f0f0, #e0e0e0)`:** This creates a subtle gradient background.  The colors are very similar to keep it understated.  You can experiment with different colors and directions.
* **`border-radius: 10px;`:** This rounds the corners of the card.  Adjust the value to control the roundness.
* **`box-shadow`:** This is crucial for the 3D effect. We use two shadows: one darker shadow slightly offset downwards and to the right, and a lighter shadow offset upwards and to the left. This creates the illusion of light and depth. The `rgba()` function allows us to control the opacity of the shadows. Experimenting with the blur radius (third value) will greatly affect the final look.
* **Padding:** This ensures proper spacing between the card's content and its edges.
