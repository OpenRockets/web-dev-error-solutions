# üêû CSS Challenge:  Modern Card Design with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a modern-looking card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature a gradient background, rounded corners, a subtle shadow, and styled text content.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes to achieve this efficiently.


## Description of the Styling

The card will be rectangular with soft rounded corners.  It will have a background gradient transitioning between two shades of blue.  A subtle box shadow will provide depth. The card's content will include a title, a short description, and a button.  The text will be styled for readability and visual appeal, using Tailwind's typography utilities.
