[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a modern, clean card design using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, a title, a short description, and a call-to-action button.  The goal is to demonstrate understanding of Tailwind's utility classes for responsive design and styling.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. It will have rounded corners, a subtle shadow, and a clean layout. The image will be positioned at the top, followed by the title, description, and button. We'll use Tailwind's pre-defined colors and spacing utilities to ensure consistent styling.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100\">\n  <img class=\"rounded-t-lg\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620652828368-8f5a8c753772?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTd8fGNhcmR8ZW58MHx8MHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n  <div class=\"p-5\">\n    <h5 class=\"mb-2 text-xl font-bold tracking-tight\">Noteworthy Product</h5>\n    <p class=\"mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400\">This is a longer card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.

They control the layout, padding, text size, and font weight.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Official Website:** [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The official documentation is an excellent resource for learning about all the utility classes and customizing Tailwind.\n* **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:** [Numerous cheat sheets available via a Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=tailwind+css+cheat+sheet) - Cheat sheets provide a quick reference for Tailwind's classes.\n* **Learn CSS Grid:** [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - While not directly used here, understanding grid layout is valuable for more complex card designs.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
