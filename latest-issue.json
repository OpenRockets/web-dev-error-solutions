[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a responsive image card using Tailwind CSS. The card should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, maintaining a visually appealing aspect ratio for the image.  We'll focus on clean, semantic HTML and concise Tailwind classes for styling.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe image card will feature:\n\n* **Responsive Image:** The image will scale proportionally with the container, preventing distortion.\n* **Rounded Corners:**  Gentle rounded corners for a softer look.\n* **Shadow:** A subtle box shadow for visual depth.\n* **Padding:** Internal padding to create breathing room around the image.\n* **Hover Effect:** On hover, the card will subtly scale up, adding an interactive element.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n<title>Responsive Image Card</title>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg hover:shadow-2xl hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n    <img class=\"w-full h-auto\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/500x300\" alt=\"Placeholder Image\">\n    <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n      <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Image Title</div>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** Centers the card horizontally and adds padding.\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* **`rounded overflow-hidden`:** Adds rounded corners and hides any overflow from the image.\n* **`shadow-lg hover:shadow-2xl`:**  Applies a box shadow and enhances it on hover.\n* **`hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out`:** Creates the hover scaling effect with smooth transitions.\n* **`w-full h-auto` (image):** Makes the image responsive by taking the full width of its container while maintaining its aspect ratio.\n* **Tailwind classes within the `<div>`:**  These style the text content within the card.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - The official documentation is an excellent resource for learning about all the available classes and customization options.\n* **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:**  A quick reference guide to the many classes available (search online for \"Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet\").\n* **CSS Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) - A valuable website with articles and tutorials on various CSS topics.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
