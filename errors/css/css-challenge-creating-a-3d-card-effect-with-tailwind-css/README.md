# üêû CSS Challenge:  Creating a 3D Card Effect with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature a title, a short description, and a button. The 3D effect will be achieved through clever use of shadows and transforms.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners. It will have a light background color with a subtle drop shadow to give it a lifted appearance.  The title will be prominently displayed, while the description will be smaller and slightly less prominent. A call-to-action button will be placed at the bottom, styled to be visually distinct.


**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700">
  <div class="p-5">
    <h5 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Noteworthy Title</h5>
    <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">A short description goes here, explaining the purpose and content of this card.  It can be a few lines long to provide sufficient context.</p>
    <a href="#" class="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-center text-white bg-blue-700 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800">

**Explanation:**

* `max-w-sm`: Sets a maximum width for the card.
* `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.  `dark:bg-gray-800` provides a dark mode alternative.
* `rounded-lg`: Applies rounded corners.
* `shadow-md`: Adds a medium-sized drop shadow.
* `p-5`: Adds padding.
* `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, etc.: Style the title using Tailwind's typography utilities.
* The button uses further Tailwind classes for styling, including hover and focus states.  Dark mode variations are included.
