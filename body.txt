## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating sorted structures for specific fields, creating too many indexes or indexes on the wrong fields can lead to performance bottlenecks.  This is because every write operation (insert, update, delete) incurs an overhead for updating all affected indexes.  Excessive indexing increases the write time and consumes significant disk space, potentially degrading overall database performance, especially under heavy write load. This can manifest as slow write operations and increased latency across the board, despite having indexes on frequently queried fields.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields like `name`, `category`, `price`, `description`, and `createdAt`.  We've added indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and `createdAt`, but only `name` and `category` are frequently used in queries.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

First, we need to identify which indexes are not providing significant performance benefits.  We can use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes:

```javascript
use productsDb; // Replace productsDb with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of indexes, including their names, keys, and other metadata. Analyze this output to see which indexes are rarely used in your application's query patterns.

**Step 2: Drop Unused Indexes**

Once you've identified unnecessary indexes, you can drop them using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command. For example, if you determine that the index on `price` and `createdAt` are unused:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({ price: 1 })
db.products.dropIndex({ createdAt: 1 })
```

**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor your MongoDB instance's performance.  Use monitoring tools (like MongoDB Compass's profiling capabilities or tools like `mongostat`) to observe write times and overall database latency.  This helps confirm whether removing the indexes has improved performance.


## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to the "write penalty" because every write operation needs to update every single index.  If you have many indexes, this update process becomes computationally expensive and slows down write performance. The disk space consumed by indexes also adds to storage costs and can impact read performance if the indexes become too large, fragmenting the disk.  The principle is to have indexes only on frequently queried fields that significantly improve query speed, outweighing the write overhead.
