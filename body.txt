## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is encountering performance degradation due to having too many indexes. While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an excessive number can negatively impact write operations and overall database performance.  This is because every write operation needs to update all relevant indexes, making insertion and update slower.  The error itself isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance bottleneck manifested as slow queries, especially writes, and high CPU usage.  MongoDB's profiler can help identify this issue by showing index usage and write times.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection called `products`.  Assume your MongoDB instance is running locally and accessible via the `mongosh` shell.

**Step 1: Identify Overly Indexed Fields:**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the `products` collection. Analyze the usage of each index.  You'll need to profile your queries (see external references) to determine which indexes are actually beneficial and frequently used. Unused indexes are candidates for removal.

```javascript
// Connect to your database
use your_database_name;

// Select the collection
db.products.getIndexes();
```

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on your profiling analysis, identify indexes which are not significantly improving query performance.  Let's say you identify an index on the `color` field that's rarely used.  Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove it.  **Always back up your data before making schema changes.**

```javascript
// Remove the index on the 'color' field
db.products.dropIndex( { color: 1 } );

//Verify the index removal (optional)
db.products.getIndexes();
```


**Step 3: Re-evaluate and Optimize (Iterative Process):**

After removing some indexes, monitor your application's performance. The initial improvement might be subtle.  Continue profiling and identifying further index candidates. You might find compound indexes that are redundant because parts are covered by other, more frequently used indexes. This optimization is iterative; continuously monitor and refine.

**Step 4: Consider Compound Indexes:**

If you still face performance issues after removing indexes, analyze whether compound indexes might improve your situation. These are indexes across multiple fields, offering improved query performance for specific query patterns.  Carefully design them to cover common query patterns and avoid redundancy with existing indexes. For example:


```javascript
// Create a compound index for frequently used queries filtering by category and price.
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } );
```


## Explanation

Having too many indexes in MongoDB leads to performance issues because:

* **Write Performance Degradation:** Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all relevant indexes.  Many indexes mean more update operations per write, leading to slower writes.
* **Storage Overhead:** Indexes consume disk space.  Unnecessary indexes increase storage requirements.
* **Query Planner Complexity:** The query planner has to analyze a larger number of indexes to find the optimal execution plan, leading to increased query planning time.

The solution lies in strategically selecting indexes to cover frequently used query patterns while removing unused ones. Profilers and monitoring tools are essential for identifying performance bottlenecks and guiding index optimization.
