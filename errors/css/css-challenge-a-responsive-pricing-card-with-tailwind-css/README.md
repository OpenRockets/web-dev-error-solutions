# üêû CSS Challenge:  A Responsive Pricing Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a responsive pricing card using Tailwind CSS. The card will feature a title, a price, a list of features, and a call-to-action button.  The design will be clean, modern, and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.


## Styling Description

The pricing card will utilize a clean and modern aesthetic.  It will be contained within a card-like structure with rounded corners and a subtle shadow. The title will be prominent, the price will be clearly displayed, and the feature list will be easily scannable. The call-to-action button will have a contrasting color to draw attention.  The card will respond gracefully to different screen sizes, maintaining its visual appeal on both desktop and mobile.

## Explanation

* **`container mx-auto p-8`**: This centers the card on the page and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`**: Limits the maximum width of the card for better responsiveness.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`**: Sets the background color, rounded corners, shadow, and padding for the card.
* **Tailwind Classes for Typography**:  Tailwind's utility classes (`text-2xl`, `font-bold`, etc.) are used for styling the text elements.
* **`list-disc list-inside`**: Styles the unordered list.
* **Button Styling**:  The button uses Tailwind classes for background color, hover effect, text color, padding, and rounded corners.
