[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a responsive card grid using Tailwind CSS. The grid should dynamically adjust the number of columns based on the screen size, ensuring optimal viewing experience on various devices.  We'll aim for a clean, modern aesthetic.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card grid will contain several cards, each displaying an image and a short title. The styling will leverage Tailwind's pre-built classes for efficient development. We'll use Tailwind's grid system to achieve the responsive layout, and ensure the cards are visually appealing and well-spaced.  The goal is to have a 3-column layout on large screens, a 2-column layout on medium screens, and a 1-column layout on small screens.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Responsive Card Grid</title>\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n  <div class=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-8\">\n    <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image 1\" class=\"rounded-t-lg mb-4\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card Title 1</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-600\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image 2\" class=\"rounded-t-lg mb-4\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card Title 2</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-600\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image 3\" class=\"rounded-t-lg mb-4\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card Title 3</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-600\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <!-- Add more cards as needed -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`container mx-auto px-4 py-8`**: This centers the content and adds padding.\n* **`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`**: This sets up the responsive grid.  `grid-cols-1` is the default, `md:grid-cols-2` applies to medium screens and larger, and `lg:grid-cols-3` applies to large screens and larger. `gap-6` adds spacing between the cards.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`**:  These classes style the individual cards with a white background, rounded corners, shadow, and padding.\n*  The rest of the classes style the image and text within each card using Tailwind's utility classes.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)\n* **Tailwind CSS Grid System:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
