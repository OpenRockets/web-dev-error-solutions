[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating sorted data structures,  excessive indexing can lead to performance degradation due to increased write operations overhead.  Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all affected indexes, which can become a bottleneck if there are too many indexes, especially on frequently updated collections.  This results in slower write performance and can even impact read performance if the write contention becomes severe.  Symptoms include slow write operations and increased latency, even for simple queries.\n\n\n## Fixing Step-by-Step\n\nLet's assume we have a collection called `products` with fields `name` (string), `category` (string), `price` (number), and `description` (string).  We've created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and even a compound index on `category` and `price`.  This might be causing performance issues.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the most frequent queries against the `products` collection using MongoDB's profiling capabilities.\n\n```bash\ndb.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enable profiling level 2 (all operations)\n// ... run your application ...\ndb.system.profile.find({millis: {$gt: 10}}).sort({ts: -1}).limit(10); //Check slow queries (>10ms)\ndb.system.profile.find().forEach(function(x) {printjson(x)}) //display all profile entries\ndb.system.profile.drop(); //Disable profiling (Important!)\n```\n\nThis will show you which queries are taking the longest time.  Pay close attention to the queries and the fields they use.\n\n\n**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**\n\nBased on the profiling results, we can identify indexes that are rarely or never used. For example, if the `description` field is never used in queries, the index on `description` is unnecessary.\n\n\n**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**\n\nUse the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove the unnecessary indexes.  If, from profiling, you find that no query is ever using the index on `description`, you would remove it like this:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.dropIndex(\"description_1\"); // Assuming the index name is \"description_1\" - use db.products.getIndexes() to confirm the name\n```\n\nIf you are not sure about an index's actual usage, temporarily drop the index and monitor your application's performance. If the performance doesn't noticeably degrade, it is safe to remove the index permanently.\n\n\n**Step 4: Optimize Compound Indexes**\n\nCarefully consider compound indexes.  While they can be efficient, too many or poorly chosen compound indexes can negatively impact performance.  If a query requires both `category` and `price`, the compound index `{category: 1, price: 1}` is beneficial, but other combinations might be redundant.\n\n\n**Step 5: Regularly Review Indexes**\n\nOver time, application usage patterns can change. Regularly review your indexes (e.g., monthly or quarterly) and remove any that are no longer needed.  The `db.collection.getIndexes()` command shows all indexes on a collection.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nOver-indexing leads to write contention because every write operation necessitates updating all relevant indexes. This creates a performance bottleneck, especially in high-write environments.  The write operation overhead becomes more significant than the speed-up provided by the extra indexes.  By analyzing query patterns and removing unused or unnecessary indexes, we can reduce the write overhead and improve overall database performance.  Focusing on optimizing indexes for the most frequent and critical queries is crucial.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MongoDB Documentation on Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)\n* [MongoDB Performance Tuning](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/manage-performance/)\n* [Understanding MongoDB Profiling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.setProfilingLevel/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
