This challenge involves creating an interactive card that expands smoothly when hovered over, revealing additional content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its rapid prototyping capabilities and ease of styling.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean and modern design.  In its default state, it will show a title and a concise description. Upon hovering, the card will smoothly expand vertically, revealing a longer description and potentially additional elements like images or buttons.  We'll use Tailwind's transition and animation utilities to achieve the smooth expansion effect.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<style>
  .expandable-card {
    transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;
  }

  .expandable-card:hover {
    max-height: 300px; /* Adjust as needed */
  }
</style>
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100">

<div class="container mx-auto p-4">
  <div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-white">
    <div class="px-6 py-4">
      <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Card Title</div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
        Short description of the card content.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="px-6 py-4 expandable-card" style="max-height: 100px; overflow: hidden;">
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
        This is the longer description that will be revealed when hovering over the card.  You can add more details and content here as needed.  Consider adding images or buttons for an even richer user experience.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>

**Explanation:**

* **Tailwind Classes:** We use Tailwind classes like `bg-gray-100`, `max-w-sm`, `rounded`, `overflow-hidden`, `shadow-lg`, `bg-white`, `px-6`, `py-4`, `font-bold`, `text-xl`, `mb-2`, and `text-gray-700` for quick and easy styling.
* **`expandable-card` class:** This class applies the transition effect to the expandable section of the card.
* **`max-height` and `overflow: hidden;`:**  These styles initially limit the height of the longer description, hiding it.
* **`:hover` pseudo-class:** On hover, we increase `max-height`, revealing the hidden content smoothly thanks to the transition.
* **CSS Transition:** The CSS `transition` property ensures a smooth animation of the `max-height` change.
