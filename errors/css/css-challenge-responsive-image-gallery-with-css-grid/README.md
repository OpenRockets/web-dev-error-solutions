# üêû CSS Challenge:  Responsive Image Gallery with CSS Grid


This challenge involves creating a responsive image gallery using CSS Grid.  The goal is to display a series of images in a visually appealing and adaptable layout that rearranges itself gracefully across different screen sizes. We'll be using plain CSS (no preprocessors like Sass or Less, and no frameworks like Tailwind CSS for this example to focus on core Grid concepts).

**Description of the Styling:**

The gallery will feature a container holding multiple image elements.  CSS Grid will be used to arrange these images in a grid layout.  The number of columns will adjust based on the screen width, ensuring a responsive design.  We'll aim for a clean, minimal aesthetic with consistent spacing between images.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Responsive Image Gallery</title>
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); /* Adjust minmax value for image size */
  grid-gap: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}

.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block; /* Prevents extra space below images */
}

/* Optional: Responsive adjustments for smaller screens */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .gallery {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr)); /* Reduce image size */
  }
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="gallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
  <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
  <img src="image5.jpg" alt="Image 5">
  <img src="image6.jpg" alt="Image 6">
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

Remember to replace `"image1.jpg"`, `"image2.jpg"`, etc. with the actual paths to your images.


**Explanation:**

* **`display: grid;`**: This sets the `.gallery` container to use CSS Grid layout.
* **`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));`**: This is the core of the responsive design.  `repeat(auto-fit, ...)` automatically creates as many columns as will fit within the container.  `minmax(200px, 1fr)` specifies that each column should be at least 200px wide, but can expand to fill the available space (`1fr`).  Adjust the `200px` value to control the minimum image width.
* **`grid-gap: 20px;`**: This adds 20px of spacing between the grid items (images).
* **`@media (max-width: 768px)`**: This media query applies styles specifically for screens smaller than 768px wide. In this example, it reduces the minimum image width to 150px.  You can adjust the breakpoint and styles as needed.
* **`width: 100%; height: auto;`**: Ensures images fill their grid cells while maintaining aspect ratio.
* **`display: block;`**: Removes extra space below images caused by inline elements.
