This challenge involves creating a card that gives the illusion of depth using only CSS, specifically leveraging Tailwind CSS's utility classes for efficient styling.  The card will have a subtle shadow, a slightly raised appearance, and a gradient background for added visual interest.  We'll avoid using any JavaScript for this effect.

## Description of the Styling

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners.  The 3D effect is achieved through a combination of box-shadow, subtle transformations, and a carefully chosen background gradient.  The text content within the card will be clearly visible and well-spaced.  We'll use Tailwind's responsive design features to ensure the card looks good on various screen sizes.

## Full Code

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded-lg shadow-2xl bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500 p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Featured Card</h2>
  <p class="text-white text-lg">This is a sample text for our featured card.  It demonstrates the use of Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing and easily styled card.</p>
  <button class="mt-4 bg-white text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg px-4 py-2">Learn More</button>
</div>
```

## Explanation

* **`max-w-sm`**: This limits the card's maximum width to small size, making it responsive.
* **`rounded-lg`**: This applies a large radius to the corners, creating a smooth, modern look.
* **`shadow-2xl`**: This adds a significant box-shadow, giving the card a raised appearance.  Tailwind provides various shadow presets for ease of use.
* **`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500`**: This creates a beautiful gradient background going from blue to purple to pink. The `to-r` specifies the gradient direction as right-to-left.  You can easily change these colors to fit your design.
* **`p-6`**:  This adds padding of 6 units (usually 1.5rem) to the card's content.
* **`text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2`**: Styles the heading within the card.
* **`text-white text-lg`**: Styles the paragraph text.
* **`mt-4`**: Adds margin at the top of the button.
* **`bg-white text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg px-4 py-2`**: Styles the button with hover and focus effects.
