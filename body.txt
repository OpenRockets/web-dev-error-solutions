## Description of the Error

One common issue developers encounter in MongoDB is having too many indexes on a collection. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to several performance problems:

* **Increased write operations:**  Every index needs to be updated whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  Too many indexes drastically slow down write operations.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes consume disk space.  Many indexes can lead to significant storage overhead.
* **Slower query performance (in some cases):**  Although indexes usually speed up queries, an excessive number can sometimes hinder performance. The database might spend more time traversing the indexes than just performing a collection scan.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates the issue and resolution using the `movies` collection with several unnecessary indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Excess Indexes**

First, let's assume we have a `movies` collection with these indexes:

```bash
db.movies.getIndexes()
```

This might return something like:

```json
[
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "_id" : 1 },
    "name" : "_id_"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "title" : 1 },
    "name" : "title_1"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "year" : 1 },
    "name" : "year_1"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "genre" : 1 },
    "name" : "genre_1"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "rating" : 1, "year" : -1 },
    "name" : "rating_1_year_-1"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "director" : 1 }
  },
    {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "actors" : 1 }
  }
]
```

We might determine that indexes on `genre`, `rating` and `actors` are underutilized compared to others and can be removed to improve write performance.

**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method to remove the indexes:

```javascript
db.movies.dropIndex("genre_1");
db.movies.dropIndex("rating_1_year_-1");
db.movies.dropIndex({ "actors" : 1});
```


**Step 3: Verify Index Removal**

Check the remaining indexes:

```bash
db.movies.getIndexes()
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor write performance using MongoDB's monitoring tools or by measuring the time taken for insert/update/delete operations.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes increases write times because every write operation must update every index.  Choosing the right indexes is crucial for performance. Indexes should only be created for fields frequently used in `$eq`, `$in`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc. queries.   Composite indexes (multiple fields) are useful for queries involving multiple fields. Analyze query patterns and create indexes accordingly.  Regularly review and remove unnecessary indexes to maintain optimal database performance.
