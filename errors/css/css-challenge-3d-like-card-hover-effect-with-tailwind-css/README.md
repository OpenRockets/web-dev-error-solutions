# üêû CSS Challenge:  3D-like Card Hover Effect with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D-like hover effect using Tailwind CSS.  The card will have a clean design and will subtly transform on hover to give the impression of depth. We will achieve this using Tailwind's utility classes and simple CSS transitions.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be a rectangular box containing some text.  On hover, the card will slightly scale up and have a subtle shadow effect to enhance the 3D illusion. The background color will subtly change on hover as well.

**Full Code:**

**Explanation:**

* **`tailwind.min.css`:** This line links to the Tailwind CSS CDN, providing all the utility classes.  You can also install Tailwind locally.
* **`container mx-auto p-8`:** This centers the card horizontally and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-white`:** These classes control the card's size, rounding, shadow, and background.
* **`card` Class and the CSS Style Block:** This is where we add the transition effect for transform, box-shadow, and background-color to make the hover effect smooth.
* **`:hover` Pseudo-class:** Styles applied on mouse hover. `transform: scale(1.02)` increases the size slightly, `box-shadow` adds the depth effect, and `background-color` changes the background color.  The changes are subtle for a more elegant effect.
* **`px-6 py-4`, `px-6 pt-4 pb-2`:** These add padding to the content sections of the card.
