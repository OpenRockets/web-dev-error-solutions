## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is the overuse or inappropriate use of indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate relevant documents, creating too many indexes or indexing inappropriate fields can lead to performance degradation.  This happens because index creation and maintenance consume resources (disk space and CPU cycles).  Write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) become slower as MongoDB needs to update all affected indexes.  Furthermore, poorly chosen indexes can be ineffective for specific queries, negating their benefit.

This can manifest as slow query execution, high write latency, and increased server load, ultimately impacting the application's overall performance.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields `name` (string), `category` (string), `price` (number), and `description` (string).  We've initially created indexes on all fields individually, leading to performance issues.  The following steps illustrate how to optimize indexing:

**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns:**

Before modifying indexes, it's crucial to understand which queries are most frequent and their performance characteristics. Use the MongoDB profiler or slow query logs to identify performance bottlenecks.  This example assumes frequent queries filter by `category` and `price` range.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Indexes on `name` and `description` are likely unnecessary if they're not frequently used in query filters.  We'll remove them using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command:

```javascript
// Remove index on 'name'
db.products.dropIndex( { name: 1 } );

// Remove index on 'description'
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } );
```

**Step 3: Create Compound Index:**

For queries filtering by `category` and `price`, a compound index covering both fields is optimal:

```javascript
// Create compound index on category and price
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } ); 
```
This single compound index efficiently handles queries that use both `category` and `price` in their filter conditions. The `1` specifies ascending order; use `-1` for descending.


**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After modifying the indexes, closely monitor query execution times and server resource usage. The MongoDB profiler and monitoring tools can help assess the impact of the changes.


## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They are B-tree structures that speed up data retrieval. A compound index combines multiple fields, making it efficient when queries involve those fields together.  When you create an index on a field, MongoDB builds and maintains that index for every write operation. Over-indexing leads to increased write overhead.  Furthermore, if an index is never used in any query, it's a complete waste of resources.  The key is to identify the most frequent and important query patterns and create indexes specifically tailored to those patterns.
