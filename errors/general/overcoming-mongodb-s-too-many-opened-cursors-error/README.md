# üêû Overcoming MongoDB's "Too Many Opened Cursors" Error


## Description of the Error

The "Too many opened cursors" error in MongoDB arises when your application opens numerous cursors without closing them properly.  Each cursor represents an active query against a collection, consuming resources.  Exceeding the server's configured limit (typically controlled by `wiredTigerCursorCacheSizeGB`) leads to this error, preventing new queries from executing. This is particularly common in applications that iterate through large datasets inefficiently or fail to handle exceptions that leave cursors open.


## Fixing the Error Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates a Python application that incorrectly handles cursors, leading to the error, and then shows the corrected version.

**Problem Code (Python):**

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

try:
    for document in collection.find({}):  #This loop may be large and exhaust resources without properly closing the cursor
        # Process each document
        print(document)
except pymongo.errors.OperationFailure as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    client.close() #This isn't sufficient, the cursor itself needs explicit closing

```

**Corrected Code (Python):**

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

try:
    cursor = collection.find({})
    for document in cursor:
        # Process each document
        print(document)
    cursor.close() # Explicitly close the cursor
except pymongo.errors.OperationFailure as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except Exception as e: # Catch any potential error during the processing
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    if 'cursor' in locals() and cursor: #Check if cursor exists before closing
      cursor.close()
finally:
    client.close()

```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

The corrected code introduces two key changes:

1. **Explicit Cursor Closure:** The `cursor.close()` method is explicitly called after the loop completes. This releases the resources held by the cursor, preventing resource exhaustion.

2. **Improved Exception Handling:** The code includes a `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions during document processing.  This is crucial because exceptions might leave the cursor open. The improved `except` block checks the existence of `cursor` before attempting to close it to prevent errors.

3. **Proper `finally` block:** The `finally` block ensures that the client connection is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred.

##  Explanation of the Problem

The fundamental issue is resource management.  MongoDB allocates resources for each open cursor. If your application opens many cursors (e.g., by making numerous queries within a loop without closing them) and fails to release those resources, it can exhaust MongoDB's available resources, leading to the "too many opened cursors" error.  This limits the database's capacity to handle new requests. This problem is often worsened by  applications that have long-running operations that don‚Äôt explicitly close the cursor. This could be due to poorly managed loops, unhandled exceptions, or lack of proper resource cleanup mechanisms.
