# üêû CSS Challenge:  Creating a 3D Card Effect with CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing 3D card effect using only CSS. We'll leverage CSS3 properties like `box-shadow`, `transform`, and `transition` to achieve a realistic and interactive card.  No JavaScript is required.

## Description of the Styling

The goal is to build a card that appears to have depth and slightly lifts when hovered over. This will be achieved by using strategically placed box shadows to simulate light and depth, and a subtle transform to lift the card on hover.  The card will have a clean, modern aesthetic.  We will utilize Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.

}
</style>

<body class="bg-gray-100 p-10">

<div class="max-w-sm mx-auto">
  <div class="card">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">My 3D Card</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">This is a simple card with a 3D effect created using only CSS.</p>

## Explanation

* **`@apply bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out;`**: This line leverages Tailwind CSS's utility classes.  It sets the card's background to white (`bg-white`), adds a large shadow (`shadow-lg`), rounds the corners (`rounded-lg`), adds padding (`p-6`), and enables smooth transitions for the transform property (`transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out`).

* **`transform translate-y-[-5px]`**: This Tailwind class translates the card 5 pixels upwards on hover, creating the lifting effect.

* **`shadow-2xl`**: On hover, a larger shadow is applied (`shadow-2xl`) to enhance the 3D illusion.
