# 🐞 Handling "FieldValue.serverTimestamp() is not a function" in Firebase Firestore when Storing Post Timestamps


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Firebase Firestore to store timestamps associated with posts or other time-sensitive data: the `"FieldValue.serverTimestamp() is not a function"` error. This typically arises from incorrect import or usage of the `FieldValue` object.

**Description of the Error:**

The error message `"FieldValue.serverTimestamp() is not a function"` indicates that your code is attempting to use the `serverTimestamp()` function on an object that doesn't possess this method. This usually means you've either not imported `FieldValue` correctly from the Firebase SDK, or you're trying to use it in an incompatible context.  Server timestamps are crucial for ensuring accurate data ordering and reflecting the server's clock, preventing discrepancies caused by client-side clock variations.


**Fixing the Error: Step-by-Step Code**

Let's assume we're creating a blog post with a timestamp indicating when it was created.  The incorrect and correct approaches are shown below:


**Incorrect Code (Leads to the error):**

```javascript
// Incorrect - Missing import or incorrect usage
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const db = getFirestore();

const createPost = async (postTitle, postContent) => {
  await db.collection("posts").add({
    title: postTitle,
    content: postContent,
    timestamp: FieldValue.serverTimestamp() // Incorrect Usage.
  });
};
```


**Correct Code:**

```javascript
import { getFirestore, collection, addDoc, serverTimestamp } from "firebase/firestore";

const db = getFirestore();

const createPost = async (postTitle, postContent) => {
  try {
    const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "posts"), {
      title: postTitle,
      content: postContent,
      timestamp: serverTimestamp() // Correct Usage.
    });
    console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error adding document: ", e);
  }
};


// Example usage
createPost("My First Post", "This is the content of my first post.");
```

**Explanation:**

The key change is the import and the use of `serverTimestamp()`.

1. **Import:** The correct code imports `serverTimestamp` directly from `firebase/firestore`.  The older method of accessing `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` is outdated and no longer functions correctly.

2. **Usage:** `serverTimestamp()` is now called directly, not as a method of a `FieldValue` object.  This is the updated and recommended approach by the Firebase team.

3. **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block is added for robust error handling. This prevents the application from crashing if the database operation fails.

**Further Considerations:**

* Ensure you've correctly initialized your Firebase project and installed the necessary Firebase JavaScript SDK packages.
* Verify that your Firebase rules allow writing to the `posts` collection.  Improperly configured rules can also lead to errors.
