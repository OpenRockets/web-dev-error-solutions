# üêû CSS Challenge:  Animated Gradient Button with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating an animated gradient button using Tailwind CSS. The button will have a smooth transition between two colors on hover, creating a visually appealing and interactive element.  We'll use Tailwind's utility classes for efficient styling and avoid writing lengthy custom CSS.

## Description of the Styling

The button will be rectangular with rounded corners.  The base color will be a soft blue, transitioning to a brighter cyan on hover.  The animation will be smooth and subtle, enhancing the user experience.  The text within the button will be white, ensuring good contrast against the gradient background.

## Explanation

* **`bg-gradient-to-r`**: This Tailwind class creates a linear gradient from left to right.  You can change `to-r` to other directions like `to-b` (bottom), `to-t` (top), `to-l` (left), `to-br` (bottom right), etc.
* **`from-blue-500 to-cyan-500`**: These classes define the starting and ending colors of the gradient. Tailwind offers a wide range of pre-defined colors.  You can explore the Tailwind CSS documentation for more options.
* **`hover:from-cyan-500 hover:to-blue-500`**: These classes apply styles specifically on hover.  The gradient is reversed on hover, creating the animation effect.
* **`text-white`**: This sets the text color to white.
* **`font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-lg`**: These classes control the font weight, padding, and border radius.
* **`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`**: This adds a smooth transition effect with a duration of 300 milliseconds and an ease-in-out timing function.
