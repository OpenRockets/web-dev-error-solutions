## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly hinder write operations and overall database performance.  Adding too many indexes increases the storage space required, slows down write operations (insert, update, delete), and can even lead to degraded read performance if the indexes aren't properly utilized or become fragmented.  The database spends more time managing indexes than processing queries, resulting in a net performance loss.  This is particularly problematic with frequently updated collections.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates a scenario where a collection `products` has too many indexes, impacting write performance. We'll focus on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array of index specifications.  Examine the indexes and their usage.  Tools like MongoDB Compass can visually represent index usage and help identify underutilized ones.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage (Optional but Recommended)**

While not directly part of fixing the problem, understanding *why* indexes exist is crucial.  Use MongoDB Profiler to monitor query performance and identify which indexes are frequently used and which are not.  This involves enabling profiling and analyzing the results.

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enables profiling level 2 (all queries)
// ... perform some operations ...
db.system.profile.find() // View profiling results
db.system.profile.drop(); // Drop the profiling collection afterward
```

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on the analysis from steps 1 & 2, identify indexes that aren't significantly contributing to query performance.  Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method to remove them.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to remove (often, it's a compound index description, like `{ "name": 1, "price": -1 }`):

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```
For example, to drop an index named "price_1":

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("price_1")
```

Or, if you have the index specification:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1 } )
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor the write performance and overall database performance.  Use monitoring tools provided by MongoDB or third-party tools to track key metrics like write latency and query execution time.

## Explanation

The problem stems from a misunderstanding of the cost-benefit of indexes. While indexes speed up queries, they incur overhead during write operations.  Each write requires updating all relevant indexes, consuming resources and potentially creating bottlenecks.  Over-indexing leads to an imbalance, where the overhead of maintaining numerous indexes outweighs the benefit they provide for a small number of queries.  Identifying and removing unused or underused indexes improves write performance and reduces storage space consumption.  A proper indexing strategy involves carefully considering the most frequent queries and their selectivity.
