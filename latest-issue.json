[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a responsive image card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, a title, and a short description, all neatly arranged and adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient and concise styling.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a clean, modern look. The image will take up the majority of the card's space, maintaining its aspect ratio. The title will be prominently displayed below the image, and a concise description will follow.  The card will have rounded corners, padding, and a subtle shadow for visual appeal.  Responsiveness is key—the card should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, preventing content overflow or awkward layouts.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-white\">\n  <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/500x300\" alt=\"Sunset in the Mountains\">\n  <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n    <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Sunset over the Lake</div>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"px-6 pt-4 pb-2\">\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2\">#photography</span>\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2\">#nature</span>\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700\">#landscape</span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Limits the card's maximum width to small size.\n* **`rounded overflow-hidden`:** Adds rounded corners and prevents content overflow.\n* **`shadow-lg`:** Applies a large shadow.\n* **`bg-white`:** Sets the background color to white.\n* **`w-full` (in the `<img>` tag):** Makes the image take up the full width of its container.\n* **`px-6 py-4`:** Adds padding to the content area.\n* **`font-bold text-xl mb-2`:** Styles the title.\n* **`text-gray-700 text-base`:** Styles the description.\n* **`inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2`:** Styles the hashtags.  Each hashtag is styled individually for consistency.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official Tailwind CSS documentation is an excellent resource for learning about its utility classes and functionalities.\n* **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:** Search for \"Tailwind CSS cheatsheet\" on Google – many helpful cheat sheets are available online to quickly find the classes you need.\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) – A comprehensive resource for learning CSS.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
