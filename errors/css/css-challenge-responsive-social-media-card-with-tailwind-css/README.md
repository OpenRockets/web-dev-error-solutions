# üêû CSS Challenge:  Responsive Social Media Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a responsive social media card using Tailwind CSS. The card should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and include an image, title, description, and button. We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient and concise styling.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean and modern design.  It will utilize Tailwind's built-in responsive design features to ensure it looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  Key styling elements include:

* **Card Container:** A rounded card with a subtle shadow.
* **Image:** A responsive image that scales proportionally within the card.
* **Content:**  A clear separation between the title, description, and button.
* **Responsiveness:** The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
* **Color Scheme:** A simple and visually appealing color palette.

* `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.
* `rounded-lg`: Adds rounded corners.
* `shadow-md`: Adds a medium shadow.
* `object-cover`: Ensures the image covers the entire container.
* `text-2xl`: Sets the font size to 2xl.
*  Other classes handle colors, spacing, padding, and more.
