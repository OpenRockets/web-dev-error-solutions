# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB: having too many indexes. While indexes speed up queries, an excessive number can significantly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) and increase storage space consumption.  This can lead to decreased application performance and higher operational costs.

## Description of the Error

The error itself isn't a specific MongoDB error message but rather a performance degradation.  You'll observe slow write operations, increased storage usage, and potentially slower read operations (ironically!) if you have an excessive number of indexes, especially if many are rarely used.  Monitoring tools will reveal slow write times and high storage utilization.  Your application may become unresponsive, leading to user complaints and business disruption.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named "products" within a database called "mydatabase". Adapt the code to your specific collection and database names.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

We first need to identify which indexes are rarely or never used.  This requires analyzing query logs or using profiling to determine which indexes are actually being utilized by your application.  MongoDB Compass can help with visualizing index usage.

```bash
# Connect to the MongoDB shell
mongo mydatabase

# List all indexes on the 'products' collection.
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all indexes with their names, keys, and usage statistics (if available through profiling). Analyze the output to identify indexes that aren't frequently used.  A low hit count indicates underutilization.

**Step 2:  Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes that aren't contributing to query performance, you can remove them.

```javascript
// Remove a specific index (replace <index_name> with the actual index name)
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")

// Example: Removing an index named "price_1_category_1"
db.products.dropIndex("price_1_category_1")

// Remove multiple indexes (replace with a comma-separated list of index names)
db.products.dropIndexes(["<index_name_1>", "<index_name_2>"])

// Remove all indexes (use with caution!)
db.products.dropIndexes()
```


**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Use monitoring tools to track write times, storage usage, and query performance.  You should observe improvements in write speed and potentially storage reduction.

**Step 4:  Consider Index Optimization**

Instead of simply dropping indexes, consider optimizing your indexing strategy. For example:

* **Compound Indexes:** Use compound indexes to satisfy multiple query criteria efficiently.
* **Sparse Indexes:**  Use sparse indexes if you only need to index a subset of documents.
* **Multikey Indexes:** Use multikey indexes for arrays in your documents.
* **Avoid Over-Indexing:** Strive for a balance between read and write performance.  Too many indexes hurt write performance, while too few can hurt reads.


## Explanation

The "too many indexes" problem stems from MongoDB's internal mechanisms.  Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all applicable indexes.  With many indexes, this overhead becomes significant.  Furthermore, each index consumes storage space.  Therefore,  having indexes that aren't actively used consumes resources without providing any performance benefit.
