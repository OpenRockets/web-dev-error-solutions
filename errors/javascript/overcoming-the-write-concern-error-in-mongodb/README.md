# üêû Overcoming the "Write Concern Error" in MongoDB


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with MongoDB: write concern errors.  These errors occur when a write operation (insert, update, delete) doesn't meet the specified write concern requirements.  This usually indicates a problem with the replica set's availability or network connectivity.

## Description of the Error

A write concern error typically manifests as an exception or error message indicating that the write operation didn't achieve the desired acknowledgment level.  For instance, you might see messages like:

* `WriteConcernError: { writeConcernError: { code: 64, codeName: 'WriteConcernFailed', errmsg: 'Failed to satisfy write concern' } }`
* Specific messages detailing replica set unavailability or network connectivity issues.

This means that MongoDB couldn't guarantee the write operation's persistence according to the specified `w` (write acknowledgement) setting.  By default, `w:1` requires acknowledgment from the primary node, but more robust configurations demand acknowledgment from a majority (`w: 'majority'`) of the replica set members.

## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Example)

Let's consider a scenario where we're inserting documents into a collection, and we're encountering a write concern error due to network connectivity issues within our replica set.

**Problem:**  The following code might fail intermittently:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function insertDocument() {
  const uri = "mongodb://user:password@host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myReplicaSet";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('myDatabase');
    const collection = db.collection('myCollection');

    const doc = { name: "Example Document", value: 1 };
    const result = await collection.insertOne(doc);
    console.log(`Inserted document with ID: ${result.insertedId}`);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

insertDocument();
```


**Solution:** Improve the write concern settings to handle temporary network interruptions. We'll increase the `w` value and also add `wtimeoutMS`  to limit the time spent waiting for acknowledgment.

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function insertDocument() {
  const uri = "mongodb://user:password@host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myReplicaSet";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
    writeConcern: { w: 'majority', wtimeoutMS: 5000 } //Added writeConcern options
  });

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('myDatabase');
    const collection = db.collection('myCollection');

    const doc = { name: "Example Document", value: 1 };
    const result = await collection.insertOne(doc);
    console.log(`Inserted document with ID: ${result.insertedId}`);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

insertDocument();
```

This improved code uses `w: 'majority'`, ensuring the write is acknowledged by a majority of the replica set members, making it more resilient to temporary network issues.  The `wtimeoutMS: 5000` option sets a 5-second timeout for the write operation, preventing indefinite blocking if the connection is unavailable.

## Explanation

Write concern settings control the level of persistence guarantee for write operations. The `w` option specifies the number of nodes that must acknowledge the write before the operation is considered successful.  Using `w: 'majority'` provides higher data durability and fault tolerance, but it might slightly increase latency. The `wtimeoutMS` option helps prevent the application from hanging indefinitely when the write operation is delayed.

Choosing the appropriate write concern depends on the application's requirements for data durability and availability. For critical applications, using `w: 'majority'` is generally recommended.  For less critical applications, `w: 1` might be sufficient, though more susceptible to data loss in the event of primary node failure.
