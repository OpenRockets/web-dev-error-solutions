[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card element that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS. We'll achieve this by manipulating shadows, transforms, and hover effects.  The card will feature a title, a brief description, and an image.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a subtle box shadow to give it a lifted appearance.  A slight transform rotation will enhance the 3D illusion. On hover, the card will subtly scale up and the shadow will become more pronounced. The image will be neatly integrated, and the text will be clearly visible with appropriate padding and spacing.  The overall style aims for a clean, modern look.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n  <title>3D-like Card</title>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n  <div class=\"container mx-auto p-8\">\n    <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 transform transition duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg\">\n      <img class=\"rounded-t-lg w-full h-48 object-cover\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n      <div class=\"p-5\">\n        <h5 class=\"mb-2 text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">Card Title</h5>\n        <p class=\"mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n        <a href=\"#\" class=\"inline-flex items-center px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-center text-white bg-blue-700 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800\">\n          Learn More\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`container mx-auto p-8`:** Centers the card horizontally and adds padding.\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Sets the background color, rounded corners, and a default shadow.  `dark:` classes are included for dark mode compatibility.\n* **`transform transition duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg`:** Enables transitions and scales the card on hover, enhancing the 3D effect along with a more pronounced shadow.\n* **`img`:** Displays the image with appropriate styling.  Replace `\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\"` with your actual image URL.\n* **Inner `div` with `p-5`:** Contains the card's text content with padding.\n* **`h5`, `p`, and `a`:** Standard HTML elements for the title, description, and button.
