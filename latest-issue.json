[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a card that gives the illusion of depth using only CSS, specifically leveraging Tailwind CSS's utility classes for efficient styling.  The card will have a subtle shadow, a slightly raised appearance, and a gradient background for added visual interest.  We'll avoid using any JavaScript for this effect.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will be rectangular with rounded corners.  The 3D effect is achieved through a combination of box-shadow, subtle transformations, and a carefully chosen background gradient.  The text content within the card will be clearly visible and well-spaced.  We'll use Tailwind's responsive design features to ensure the card looks good on various screen sizes.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded-lg shadow-2xl bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500 p-6\">\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2\">Featured Card</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-white text-lg\">This is a sample text for our featured card.  It demonstrates the use of Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing and easily styled card.</p>\n  <button class=\"mt-4 bg-white text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg px-4 py-2\">Learn More</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`max-w-sm`**: This limits the card's maximum width to small size, making it responsive.\n* **`rounded-lg`**: This applies a large radius to the corners, creating a smooth, modern look.\n* **`shadow-2xl`**: This adds a significant box-shadow, giving the card a raised appearance.  Tailwind provides various shadow presets for ease of use.\n* **`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500`**: This creates a beautiful gradient background going from blue to purple to pink. The `to-r` specifies the gradient direction as right-to-left.  You can easily change these colors to fit your design.\n* **`p-6`**:  This adds padding of 6 units (usually 1.5rem) to the card's content.\n* **`text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2`**: Styles the heading within the card.\n* **`text-white text-lg`**: Styles the paragraph text.\n* **`mt-4`**: Adds margin at the top of the button.\n* **`bg-white text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg px-4 py-2`**: Styles the button with hover and focus effects.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) -  The official Tailwind CSS documentation is an excellent resource for learning about all the available utility classes and customizing your setup.\n* **CSS Box Shadow Tutorial:** Search for \"CSS box-shadow tutorial\" on YouTube or Google for many great visual explanations of how box-shadow works.\n* **Understanding CSS Gradients:** Search for \"CSS gradients tutorial\" to learn about creating various gradient effects.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
