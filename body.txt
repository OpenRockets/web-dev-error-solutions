This challenge involves creating an interactive card that expands when hovered over, revealing additional content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its rapid development capabilities and ease of styling.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will initially display a concise title and a small image. On hover, the card will smoothly expand horizontally, revealing a longer description and potentially more details.  The animation will be smooth and visually appealing. We'll utilize Tailwind's transition utilities and the `hover` pseudo-class.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Expanding Card</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100">

<div class="container mx-auto p-4">
  <div class="max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-105">
    <img class="w-full h-48 object-cover" src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="p-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Card Title</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2 hidden group-hover:block">
        This is a longer description that will be revealed when the card is hovered over.  You can add more details here as needed. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** This centers the card and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:** Limits the card's maximum width.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Sets the background color, rounded corners, and shadow.
* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card.
* **`transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out`:**  Applies a smooth transition to the transform property (scale) over 300 milliseconds.
* **`transform hover:scale-105`:** Scales the card up slightly on hover.
* **`group-hover:block`:** This is a crucial part. Tailwind's `group` utility allows us to apply hover states to a parent element and its children.  In this case, the description paragraph is initially hidden (`hidden`) and shown only when the parent (`div` with the class `group`) is hovered over (`group-hover:block`).
