This challenge involves creating a visually appealing card that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this by employing shadows, transforms, and subtle gradients to give the card depth and a sense of realism.  No external libraries or images are required.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners.  A subtle gradient will be applied to the background to add visual interest.  The key to the 3D effect is using a combination of box-shadow to create depth and `transform: rotateY()` to subtly tilt the card, giving it a sense of being slightly angled away from the viewer.  We'll also add a small inner shadow to further enhance the 3D illusion.

**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="card w-64 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 rounded-lg shadow-xl shadow-blue-600/50 transform rotate-y-2">
  <div class="p-6">
    <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3D Card</h2>
    <p class="text-white text-lg">This is a sample text demonstrating a 3D card effect created using Tailwind CSS.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`card`:** This is a custom class we can add to other elements later, if needed.
* **`w-64`:** Sets the card width to 64 units (Tailwind's default unit is usually 4px, resulting in a 256px width).
* **`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`:** Creates a linear gradient background transitioning from blue to purple along the right (r) axis.  Adjust colors as needed.
* **`rounded-lg`:** Applies large rounded corners.
* **`shadow-xl`:**  Applies a large box-shadow.
* **`shadow-blue-600/50`:**  Adds a custom blue shadow with 50% opacity to accentuate the 3D effect.
* **`transform rotate-y-2`:** Rotates the card slightly along the Y-axis. This is a subtle tilt which enhances the 3D appearance.
* **`p-6`:** Adds 6 units of padding to the inner content.
* **`text-white`:** Sets the text color to white for better contrast against the background.
* **`text-2xl font-bold`:** Styles the heading.
