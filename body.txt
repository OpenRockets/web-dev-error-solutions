This challenge involves creating a visually appealing card element that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  The card will have a subtle shadow, a slightly raised appearance, and a rounded design.  This is a great exercise for practicing Tailwind's utility-first approach and its responsive design capabilities.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be a rectangular container with:

*   A light gray background.
*   Rounded corners (using `rounded-lg`).
*   A subtle drop shadow to create the 3D effect (`shadow-md`).
*   Padding to provide internal spacing.
*   A dark gray text for the title and body content.
*   Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.


**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded-lg shadow-md bg-gray-100 p-6 mx-auto my-10">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
    This is a sample card with a 3D-like effect created using only Tailwind CSS.
    You can easily customize the styling and content to fit your needs.
  </p>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `max-w-sm`: Sets a maximum width for the card, making it responsive.
*   `rounded-lg`: Adds large rounded corners.
*   `shadow-md`: Applies a medium shadow, giving the 3D impression.
*   `bg-gray-100`: Sets a light gray background color.
*   `p-6`: Adds padding of 6 units on all sides.
*   `mx-auto`: Centers the card horizontally.
*   `my-10`: Adds margin of 10 units top and bottom.
*   `text-xl`, `font-bold`, `text-gray-800`: Styles the title.
*   `text-gray-700`, `text-base`: Styles the paragraph text.
