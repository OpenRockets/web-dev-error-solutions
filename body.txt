## Description of the Error

The `$where` operator in MongoDB allows you to specify JavaScript code for filtering documents.  While versatile, it's notoriously inefficient, especially with large datasets.  Using `$where` often leads to significantly slower query performance compared to using proper indexing and operators native to MongoDB's query language.  This is because `$where` scans the entire collection, bypassing indexes, even when applicable.  The JavaScript execution adds significant overhead, particularly for complex queries. This can manifest as slow response times, application timeouts, and ultimately, a poor user experience.


## Code Example & Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's say we have a collection called `products` with documents like this:

```json
{ "_id" : ObjectId("6548d76e4986e41439e7a968"), "name" : "Widget X", "price" : 25, "category" : "Electronics", "description": "A fantastic widget!"}
{ "_id" : ObjectId("6548d7734986e41439e7a969"), "name" : "Gizmo Y", "price" : 50, "category" : "Tools", "description": "A really useful gizmo!" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("6548d7784986e41439e7a96a"), "name" : "Thingamajig Z", "price" : 10, "category" : "Electronics", "description": "A simple thingamajig!" }
```

**Inefficient Query (using `$where`):**

```javascript
db.products.find( { $where: "this.price > 20 && this.category == 'Electronics'" } )
```

This query uses `$where` to find products priced over 20 and categorized as "Electronics".  It's inefficient because it scans the entire collection.


**Efficient Query (using indexes and native operators):**

**Step 1: Create an index:**

First, we create a compound index on `price` and `category` fields:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1, category: 1 } )
```

This index allows MongoDB to efficiently locate documents based on these fields.

**Step 2:  Rewrite the query:**

Now, rewrite the query to leverage the index:

```javascript
db.products.find( { price: { $gt: 20 }, category: "Electronics" } )
```

This revised query uses the `$gt` (greater than) operator and directly specifies the `category` field. MongoDB can utilize the created compound index to greatly speed up the query.


## Explanation

The key improvement is shifting from the inefficient `$where` operator to utilizing native MongoDB operators and indexes.  Indexes are data structures that MongoDB uses to quickly locate specific documents.  When a query involves indexed fields, MongoDB can avoid a full collection scan.  Native operators are optimized for MongoDB's internal workings and are significantly faster than the overhead introduced by the JavaScript engine processing the `$where` clause.
