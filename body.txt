This challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this through clever use of shadows, transforms, and subtle color variations to create depth and a sense of realism.  This is a great exercise for solidifying your understanding of Tailwind's utility classes and how they can be combined to create complex layouts.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will feature a clean, modern design.  It will appear to be slightly elevated from the background, creating a 3D effect. We'll use a subtle gradient for the background to further enhance the depth. The text within the card will be well-spaced and easy to read.  The overall style aims for a minimalist, professional look.

**Explanation:**

* **`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-200 to-purple-200`**: This creates a background gradient transitioning from light blue to light purple.
* **`shadow-lg`**:  Applies a large shadow to give the card a lifted appearance.
* **`rounded overflow-hidden`**: Rounds the corners and prevents content from overflowing.
* **`max-w-sm mx-auto my-10`**: Sets a maximum width and centers the card horizontally and adds margin top and bottom.
*  The rest of the classes style the text and image within the card using Tailwind's pre-defined styles.
