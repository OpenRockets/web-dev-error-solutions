## Description of the Error

The "too many indexes" error in MongoDB isn't a specific error message thrown directly by the database. Instead, it's a consequence of creating an excessive number of indexes, leading to performance degradation.  MongoDB doesn't have a hard limit on the number of indexes, but an excessive number can severely impact write operations (inserts, updates, deletes), storage space, and overall database performance. This is because each index adds overhead during write operations, and too many can cause significant slowdowns.  Furthermore, excessive indexing can negatively impact query optimization, as the query planner might struggle to choose the best index among many candidates.


## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step

This solution focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  We'll illustrate this with a practical example, assuming a collection named `products` with several indexes already in place.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all existing indexes on your `products` collection.

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array showing the index names, keys, and other metadata.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

This is crucial.  You need to understand which indexes are frequently used and which are rarely or never accessed.  MongoDB profiling can help.  Enable profiling (if not already enabled) and perform some representative queries.

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enables slow queries profiling (level 2 recommended)
```

Run queries against your `products` collection.  Then, examine the profiling logs to see which indexes are utilized.

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({ "op": "query", "ns": "your_database.products" }).sort({ "millis": -1 })
```
Replace `your_database` with your actual database name.  This query retrieves slow query logs, focusing on queries against the `products` collection, sorted by execution time (descending).  Analyze the `key` field in the results to see the indexes used.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on the profiling analysis, identify indexes rarely or never used.  Remove them using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command.  For example, if you have an index named `_id_category`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("_id_category")
```

Or if you want to drop a compound index specified using the key pattern:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({ category: 1, price: -1 })
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor the performance of your write operations and queries. Use MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's logging mechanisms to observe the improvements.  You might need to iterate on index selection, dropping some and creating others based on observed performance.


## Explanation

The key to solving the "too many indexes" problem is careful index planning and monitoring. Creating indexes is crucial for query performance, but an excessive number can negate these benefits due to the increased write overhead. By analyzing index usage through profiling and strategically dropping underutilized indexes, you can significantly improve write performance and reduce storage overhead without sacrificing query efficiency.  Remember that the optimal number of indexes is application-specific and depends on your query patterns.
