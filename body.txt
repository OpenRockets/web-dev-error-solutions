This challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card element that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS. We'll achieve this by manipulating shadows, transforms, and hover effects.  The card will feature a title, a brief description, and an image.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a subtle box shadow to give it a lifted appearance.  A slight transform rotation will enhance the 3D illusion. On hover, the card will subtly scale up and the shadow will become more pronounced. The image will be neatly integrated, and the text will be clearly visible with appropriate padding and spacing.  The overall style aims for a clean, modern look.

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-8`:** Centers the card horizontally and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Sets the background color, rounded corners, and a default shadow.  `dark:` classes are included for dark mode compatibility.
* **`transform transition duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg`:** Enables transitions and scales the card on hover, enhancing the 3D effect along with a more pronounced shadow.
* **`img`:** Displays the image with appropriate styling.  Replace `"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150"` with your actual image URL.
* **Inner `div` with `p-5`:** Contains the card's text content with padding.
* **`h5`, `p`, and `a`:** Standard HTML elements for the title, description, and button. Tailwind classes provide styling.
