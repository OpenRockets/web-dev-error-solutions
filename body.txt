## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is creating too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to several detrimental effects:

* **Write performance degradation:** Every write operation (insert, update, delete) needs to update all indexes.  Too many indexes dramatically increase write times, impacting application responsiveness.
* **Storage overhead:**  Indexes consume disk space.  An excessive number can bloat your database, leading to higher storage costs and slower query performance due to increased I/O operations.
* **Query optimization issues:** The query optimizer might struggle to choose the best index when faced with an overwhelming number of options, potentially leading to suboptimal query execution plans.
* **Increased complexity:** Managing a large number of indexes becomes complex and time-consuming.


## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates identifying and removing redundant or underutilized indexes on a collection named `products`.  We'll use the MongoDB shell for this demonstration.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes:**

First, let's list all indexes on the `products` collection and their usage statistics.  This requires enabling profiling (if not already enabled) and running some queries against your data.

```javascript
// Enable profiling level 2 (log all queries)
db.setProfilingLevel(2);

// Run some representative queries against your 'products' collection.

// Disable profiling after running the queries
db.setProfilingLevel(0);

// Fetch profiling data and find indexes used.  The following command returns all slow queries. Adapt the query to your requirements.
db.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:10}}).forEach(function(x){printjson(x)})

//Alternatively use the below to find indexes and their usage stats.  This requires a suitable aggregation pipeline to filter for index usages
//Replace <yourDatabaseName> and <yourCollectionName> with your database and collection names.
db.getSiblingDB("<yourDatabaseName>").command(
{
    aggregate: "<yourCollectionName>",
    pipeline: [
    {
        $group:
        {
            _id:"$key",
            count:{$sum:1}
        }
    }
]
}
)
```

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage:**

Review the profiler output or the aggregation result.  Look for indexes that haven't been used in a significant number of queries or are significantly underutilized.

**Step 3: Remove Redundant or Unused Indexes:**

Once you've identified unused or redundant indexes, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index to be dropped (you can obtain this from the output of `db.collection.getIndexes()`).

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>");
```

For example, if you have an index on `{"name": 1, "price": 1}` and another on `{"name": 1}`, the second index might be redundant since the first one covers all queries that use just the `name` field.

**Step 4:  Re-evaluate Index Strategy (Optional):**

After removing indexes, assess if you need to create new, more efficient indexes based on the common query patterns in your application. Tools like MongoDB Compass can help visualize index usage and suggest improvements.


## Explanation

The "too many indexes" problem arises from a lack of strategic index planning and ongoing monitoring. While indexes are crucial for query performance, their overuse introduces significant write overhead and storage costs. The steps above outline a systematic approach to identify and remove unnecessary indexes, improving overall database performance and efficiency. Remember that creating and removing indexes are inherently write operations; if you are dealing with high-write loads, schedule such maintenance to periods of low activity.
