## Description of the Error

The `$where` operator in MongoDB allows you to specify JavaScript code for filtering documents. While flexible, using `$where` often leads to significant performance issues, especially with large datasets. This is because the JavaScript code executes on the server for *every* document in the collection, regardless of whether it matches the criteria. This full collection scan bypasses the use of indexes, resulting in dramatically slower query times.  This can manifest as extremely slow queries, timeouts, and potentially application instability.

## Fixing Step-by-Step with Code

Let's consider a scenario where we want to find all documents in a "products" collection where the price, stored as a string, is greater than 100.  The *incorrect* approach using `$where`:

```javascript
db.products.find( { $where: "this.price > 100" } )
```

This is inefficient.  The correct approach involves proper data modeling and index usage.


**Step 1: Correct Data Modeling**

First, ensure your `price` field is of the correct data type – a Number (e.g., `NumberInt`, `NumberLong` depending on your needs).  If it's currently a string, you need to update your documents:

```javascript
db.products.find().forEach(function(doc) {
  if(typeof doc.price === 'string'){
    db.products.update(
      { _id: doc._id },
      { $set: { price: parseInt(doc.price) } }
    );
  }
})
```

This script iterates through each document and converts the `price` field from a string to an integer if it's a string.  **Note:** For very large collections, this update can also be slow. Consider using bulk operations for better performance.


**Step 2: Create an Index**

Once the `price` field is a Number, create an index on it:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
```

This creates an ascending index on the `price` field.  MongoDB can now efficiently use this index to find documents matching the criteria.


**Step 3: Efficient Query**

Now, use a standard query leveraging the index:

```javascript
db.products.find( { price: { $gt: 100 } } )
```

This query directly uses the `$gt` (greater than) operator and the index, resulting in significantly improved performance.


## Explanation

The core issue with `$where` is its inability to use indexes.  By using the correct data type and creating an index, the query optimizer can utilize these structures for fast lookups.  The `$gt` operator, and other comparison operators like `$lt`, `$gte`, `$lte`, `$eq`, `$ne`, are specifically designed to work with indexes.  The `$where` operator essentially forces a full table scan, making it a last resort for complex queries that cannot be expressed with standard operators and indexes.
