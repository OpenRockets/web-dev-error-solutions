# üêû CSS Challenge: Responsive Image Card with Shadow and Hover Effect


This challenge involves creating a responsive image card using CSS. The card will feature a background image, a subtle shadow, and a hover effect that slightly enlarges the card and increases the shadow intensity.  We'll use plain CSS for this example, demonstrating fundamental techniques applicable to any CSS framework (like Tailwind).

## Description of the Styling

The card will be a rectangular container holding an image. The styling includes:

* **Base Styling:**  Fixed width (e.g., 300px) and a `max-width` of 100% for responsiveness.  Padding to create space around the image.  A subtle box shadow.
* **Background Image:** The background image will cover the entire card.
* **Hover Effect:** On hover, the card will slightly increase in size (e.g., 1.05 scale) and the box shadow will become more pronounced.
* **Responsiveness:** The card will adapt to different screen sizes, maintaining its aspect ratio.


## Full Code

```css
.image-card {
  width: 300px;
  max-width: 100%;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  padding: 10px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Initial shadow */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */
}

.image-card img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block; /* Remove extra space below image */
}

.image-card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */
}
```

**HTML (Example):**

```html
<div class="image-card" style="background-image: url('your-image.jpg');">
  <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Image Description">
</div>
```

Remember to replace `'your-image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image.


## Explanation

* **`width: 300px; max-width: 100%;`**:  Sets a base width but allows the card to shrink to fit smaller screens.
* **`background-size: cover; background-position: center;`**: Ensures the background image fills the container and is centered.
* **`box-shadow`**: Creates the shadow effect.  The `rgba()` function allows for semi-transparent shadows.
* **`transition`**:  Specifies properties that should animate smoothly on hover.
* **`transform: scale(1.05);`**:  Enlarges the card on hover.
* **`:hover`**:  Applies styles specifically when the mouse hovers over the element.
