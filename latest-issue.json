[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a card that expands smoothly on hover, revealing more content.  We'll use CSS3 transitions and transforms to achieve this effect. No JavaScript is required.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a clean, minimalist design.  On hover, the card will increase in width and height, revealing hidden content (in this example, additional text). The transition will be smooth and visually appealing.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out, height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add transition for smooth animation */\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  width: 500px;\n  height: 300px;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  /* Initially hidden, will be revealed on expand */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h2>Card Title</h2>\n  <p>This is some initial card content.</p>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This additional content is initially hidden and will be revealed on hover.</p>\n    <p>The card smoothly expands to accommodate it.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out, height 0.3s ease-in-out;`:** This CSS property is crucial for the animation. It specifies that the `width` and `height` properties should transition smoothly over 0.3 seconds, using an \"ease-in-out\" timing function (which provides a natural acceleration and deceleration).\n\n* **`.card:hover { width: 500px; height: 300px; }`:** This selector targets the card element when the mouse hovers over it.  The `width` and `height` are increased to reveal the hidden content.\n\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:**  This is applied to the card initially to hide the extra content that will be revealed on hover.\n\n* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the hidden content within the card.  You can add more detailed styling as needed.\n\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS3 Tutorial:** [W3Schools CSS3 Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_intro.asp)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
