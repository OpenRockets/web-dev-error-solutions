This challenge involves creating an interactive card that expands smoothly when hovered over, revealing additional content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its rapid prototyping capabilities and ease of styling.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will start in a compact state, displaying a title and a small image. On hover, it will smoothly expand horizontally, revealing a longer description and potentially other elements.  We'll use Tailwind's transition utilities for the animation.  The overall style will be clean and modern.

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** This centers the card and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Styles the card background, corners, and shadow.
* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card boundaries during the transition.
* **`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`:** Applies a smooth transition with a duration of 300ms and an ease-in-out timing function.
* **`hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105`:** Increases the shadow and scales up the card slightly on hover.
* **`line-clamp-2`:** Limits the number of lines shown in the description initially (using a pseudo-element or plugin that would not be part of default tailwind).  This needs to be substituted with a js approach or a css solution depending on the version of tailwind or added plugins used.
* **`hidden group-hover:block`:** Hides the longer description initially and reveals it on hover using Tailwind's group modifier.  This requires `group` to be added as a class to the parent element.
