This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing and modern card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, title, description, and a button.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for rapid and efficient styling.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. It will have rounded corners, a subtle shadow, and a clean layout. The image will be placed at the top, followed by the title, description, and finally, a call-to-action button. We'll use Tailwind's color palette for a consistent and visually pleasing aesthetic.

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-6`:** Centers the card horizontally and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:** Limits the card's maximum width.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Sets the background color, rounded corners, and shadow.
* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card boundaries.
* **`object-cover`:** Ensures the image covers the entire container.
* **Tailwind Typography Classes:**  `text-xl`, `font-bold`, `text-gray-800`, etc., are used for text styling.
* **`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700`:** Styles the button with a blue background and a hover effect.
