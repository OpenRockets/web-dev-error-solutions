[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card element using Tailwind CSS to mimic a 3D effect. We'll achieve this using shadows, transforms, and hover effects.  The card will feature an image, a title, and a brief description.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a subtle 3D effect created by using a box shadow and a slight transform. On hover, the card will scale slightly and the shadow will become more pronounced, enhancing the 3D illusion. The colors will be clean and modern, using a light gray background and a darker gray for the shadow.  The text will be clearly legible and well-spaced.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-lg mx-auto my-8 bg-gray-100\">\n  <img class=\"w-full h-48 object-cover\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/500x300\" alt=\"Card Image\" />\n  <div class=\"p-4\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2\">Card Title</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-600 text-base\">\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n      Nulla facilisi.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-w-sm`**: Limits the card's maximum width.\n* **`rounded-lg`**: Adds large rounded corners.\n* **`overflow-hidden`**: Prevents content from overflowing the card.\n* **`shadow-lg`**: Applies a large box shadow for the 3D effect.\n* **`mx-auto`**: Centers the card horizontally.\n* **`my-8`**: Adds margin to the top and bottom.\n* **`bg-gray-100`**: Sets the background color to light gray.\n* **`w-full h-48 object-cover`**: Makes the image full width, 48 units high, and covers the entire area.  Replace `\"https://via.placeholder.com/500x300\"` with your image URL.\n* **`p-4`**: Adds padding to the content area.\n* **`text-xl font-bold text-gray-800`**: Styles the title.\n* **`text-gray-600 text-base`**: Styles the description.\n\n\n**To add Hover Effects (Advanced):**\n\nYou can enhance this further with hover effects using Tailwind's hover modifiers:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-lg mx-auto my-8 bg-gray-100 transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-xl\">\n  <!-- ...rest of the code remains the same... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThis adds a smooth transition (`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`), scales the card on hover (`hover:scale-105`), and increases the shadow (`hover:shadow-xl`).\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Official Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  -  This is the best place to learn about all of Tailwind's utilities.\n* **CSS Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) - A great resource for learning CSS techniques and best practices.\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) -  A comprehensive reference for all things CSS.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
