[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen working with geospatial data in MongoDB, developers often encounter performance issues when querying for locations near a specific point using the `$near` operator.  Without a correctly configured geospatial index, these queries can be incredibly slow, especially with large datasets.  The problem arises when the index is missing, incorrect (wrong type), or not optimized for the specific query.  This can manifest as extremely long query execution times or even query timeouts.\n\n## Full Code of Fixing Step by Step\n\nLet's assume we have a collection named `restaurants` with documents like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"The Italian Place\",\n  \"location\": {\n    \"type\": \"Point\",\n    \"coordinates\": [-73.9712, 40.7838] //Longitude, Latitude\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 1: Create a 2dsphere index.**  The `2dsphere` index is crucial for efficient geospatial queries on spherical coordinates (longitude, latitude).\n\n```javascript\n// Using the MongoDB shell\ndb.restaurants.createIndex( { location : \"2dsphere\" } )\n```\n\n**Step 2: Verify index creation.** Check if the index was successfully created.\n\n```javascript\ndb.restaurants.getIndexes()\n```\n\nThis will return a list of indexes, including the newly created geospatial index.  Look for one with `key` `{ \"location\" : 1 }` and `name` likely `location_2dsphere`.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a `$near` query with the optimized index.**\n\n```javascript\ndb.restaurants.find( {\n  location: {\n    $near: {\n      $geometry: {\n        type: \"Point\",\n        coordinates: [-73.98, 40.76]\n      },\n      $maxDistance: 1000 // in meters\n    }\n  }\n} )\n```\nThis query efficiently finds restaurants within a 1000-meter radius of the specified point due to the `2dsphere` index.\n\n\n**Step 4 (Optional): Using `$nearSphere` for improved accuracy.**\n\nFor improved accuracy over large distances, consider using `$nearSphere` which uses a spherical model for distance calculations.\n\n```javascript\ndb.restaurants.find( {\n  location: {\n    $nearSphere: {\n      $geometry: {\n        type: \"Point\",\n        coordinates: [-73.98, 40.76]\n      },\n      $maxDistance: 1000 / 6371000 // in radians, earth radius in meters is ~6371000\n    }\n  }\n} )\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core issue is the lack of or an unsuitable geospatial index.  Without an index, MongoDB performs a collection scan, examining every document to find matches.  This is extremely inefficient for large datasets.\n\nThe `2dsphere` index organizes the data spatially, allowing MongoDB to quickly locate documents within a specified radius. It supports queries using `$near` and `$nearSphere`.  `$nearSphere` offers better accuracy for longer distances as it accounts for the curvature of the earth.  Remember to convert distances to radians when using `$nearSphere`.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **MongoDB Geospatial Indexes:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/)\n* **MongoDB GeoJSON:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/)\n* **$near and $nearSphere operators:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/near/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/near/)\n* **$nearSphere Operator:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
