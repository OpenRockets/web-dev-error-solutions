This challenge focuses on creating a responsive image gallery using Tailwind CSS.  The goal is to build a grid-based gallery that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a visually appealing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  Images will be displayed in a clean and modern layout, with appropriate spacing and responsiveness.

**Description of the Styling:**

The gallery will utilize Tailwind's grid system to arrange images.  We'll use responsive classes to adjust the number of columns based on screen size. Images will be contained within cards with subtle shadows and hover effects.  The overall style will be minimalist and modern.

**Full Code:**

    </div>
    <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Image 4" class="w-full">
    </div>
    <!-- Add more image divs as needed -->

```

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** Centers the gallery and adds padding.
* **`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4`:** This is the core of the responsive grid.  It starts with one column and increases the number of columns based on screen size (sm, md, lg). `gap-4` adds spacing between the images.
* **`bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg overflow-hidden`:** Styles each image container with a white background, shadow, rounded corners, and prevents image overflow.
* **`w-full`:** Makes the image take up the full width of its container.
