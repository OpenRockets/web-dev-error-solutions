# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


**Description of the Error:**

A common problem in MongoDB arises from creating too many indexes. While indexes drastically improve query performance, an excessive number can severely impact write operations.  Adding an index involves extra disk space and time during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  Excessive indexing leads to:

* **Slower write performance:** Each write operation needs to update all relevant indexes, resulting in significant overhead.
* **Increased storage consumption:** Indexes themselves consume storage space. Too many indexes increase overall database size.
* **Performance degradation during `$geoNear` queries:** If you have several indexes on the same geometry field, `$geoNear` queries will suffer.
* **Increased complexity:** Managing a large number of indexes becomes a maintenance nightmare.


**Code (Fixing Step-by-Step):**

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes. We'll assume you have a collection named `products` and want to optimize its indexes.

**1. Identify Existing Indexes:**

```bash
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all indexes on the `products` collection.  Examine the output carefully to understand which indexes are in use and their usage patterns. Look for indexes that are rarely or never used.

**2. Analyze Query Logs:**

Using MongoDB's profiling capabilities, you can identify frequently used query patterns and which indexes are used or missed. Enabling profiling:

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(2) //Enables profiling level 2 (slow queries)
```

After running queries, analyze the `system.profile` collection:

```bash
db.system.profile.find({ millis: { $gt: 10 } }).sort({ millis: -1 })
```
This shows queries that took more than 10ms.  Analyze these to see if indexes are being utilized or if new ones need to be added.  Don't forget to disable profiling afterwards:

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```


**3. Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified underused or redundant indexes, remove them. For example, to remove an index on the `sku` field:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("sku_1") //Replace "sku_1" with the actual index name
```


**4.  Strategically Add or Modify Indexes:**

Instead of creating many indexes, focus on creating composite indexes that cover multiple fields frequently used in query filters.  For example:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This creates a compound index for efficient queries filtering by `category` and `price`.



**Explanation:**

The key is to achieve a balance.  Indexes improve read performance, but too many indexes negatively impact write performance.  By analyzing your query patterns (using profiling) and strategically selecting appropriate indexes, you can optimize your database for both read and write efficiency.  Regularly reviewing and adjusting your indexes is crucial for maintaining optimal performance.
