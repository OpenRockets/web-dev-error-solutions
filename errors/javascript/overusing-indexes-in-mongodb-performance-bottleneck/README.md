# üêû Overusing Indexes in MongoDB: Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is overusing indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, creating too many or incorrectly designed indexes can lead to performance degradation, especially during write operations.  The problem arises because every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all affected indexes, increasing write times.  Additionally, excessive indexes consume significant disk space and can lead to slower query planning as MongoDB needs to evaluate many possible index options.  This results in slower application performance and increased infrastructure costs.  The symptom often manifests as unexpectedly slow write operations and high write latency.

## Fixing the Problem Step by Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields `name` (string), `category` (string), `price` (number), and `description` (string).  We've created indexes on `name`, `category`, and `price` individually:

```javascript
// Incorrect - Over-indexing
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
```

This is inefficient if queries rarely use these fields individually.  A better strategy is to analyze query patterns and create compound indexes that satisfy multiple queries.

**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns**

Examine your application's code and logs to identify frequently used queries. This is crucial for effective index creation.  Let's assume the most frequent queries are:

* Finding products by category and price range: `db.products.find({ category: "Electronics", price: { $gte: 50, $lte: 100 } })`
* Finding products by name: `db.products.find({ name: "Widget X" })`

**Step 2: Create Optimized Compound Indexes**

Based on the query patterns, we create compound indexes:

```javascript
// Correct - Optimized Indexing
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } ) //For category & price range queries
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } ) // Retaining the index for name searches as it's frequently used.
```

The first index efficiently supports queries filtering by `category` and `price`. The second index remains for name-based searches.  Note that the order of fields in a compound index is significant.

**Step 3:  Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

After optimizing, drop unnecessary indexes:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1 } ) // Drop the individual price index.
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After implementing the changes, monitor your application's performance. Use MongoDB's profiling tools and metrics to observe the impact of the optimized indexes on both read and write operations.

## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to:

* **Increased write times:**  Each write operation updates all indexes.
* **Increased storage space:**  Indexes consume significant disk space.
* **Slower query planning:** MongoDB must evaluate more potential index options.

Creating compound indexes that cover multiple query patterns reduces the number of indexes and improves performance. Carefully analyzing query patterns is crucial for effective index optimization.  Remember to use `db.collection.getIndexes()` to list existing indexes.
