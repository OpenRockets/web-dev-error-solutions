**Description of the Error:**

A common problem when working with Firebase Firestore and handling posts (or any frequently updated data) is maintaining data consistency when multiple users or clients attempt to write to the same document concurrently.  This can lead to unexpected data overwrites, lost updates, or race conditions, resulting in incorrect data being stored.  For instance, imagine a "likes" counter on a post. If multiple users like the post simultaneously, the counter might not accurately reflect the total number of likes.


**Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step:**

This example demonstrates how to solve this using Firestore transactions.  We'll increment a "likes" counter on a post document.

**Code:**

```javascript
import { getFirestore, doc, getDoc, updateDoc, runTransaction } from "firebase/firestore";

const db = getFirestore();

async function incrementPostLikes(postId) {
  try {
    const postRef = doc(db, "posts", postId);

    await runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
      const postSnapshot = await transaction.get(postRef);

      if (!postSnapshot.exists()) {
        throw new Error("Post not found!");
      }

      const currentLikes = postSnapshot.data().likes || 0; // Handle cases where likes might not exist yet.
      const newLikes = currentLikes + 1;

      transaction.update(postRef, { likes: newLikes });
    });

    console.log("Likes incremented successfully!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error incrementing likes:", error);
  }
}


// Example usage:
incrementPostLikes("postID123");
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary functions:** We import the required functions from the Firebase Firestore library.
2. **Initialize Firestore:** `getFirestore()` initializes the Firestore instance.
3. **`incrementPostLikes` function:** This function takes the `postId` as input.
4. **`runTransaction`:** This is the crucial part. It ensures that the read and write operations are atomic.  It guarantees that no other client can modify the document between the read and the write.
5. **Get the document:** Inside the transaction, `transaction.get(postRef)` retrieves the current state of the post document.
6. **Handle non-existent documents:** The `if (!postSnapshot.exists())` check handles the case where the post doesn't exist.  Throwing an error is a good way to gracefully handle this situation.
7. **Increment likes:** We safely read the current `likes` count (handling potential null values) and increment it.
8. **Update the document:** `transaction.update(postRef, { likes: newLikes })` atomically updates the document with the new likes count.  The transaction ensures that this update only happens if the document hasn't changed since it was read.
9. **Error handling:** The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during the transaction.

**Why Transactions are Important:**

Using transactions prevents race conditions and ensures data consistency. Without transactions, if multiple users increment the likes concurrently, the final count might be lower than the actual number of likes due to overwrites.  Transactions guarantee atomicity, ensuring that either all operations within the transaction succeed, or none do.
