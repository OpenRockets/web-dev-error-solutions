# üêû Overcoming MongoDB "Too Many Indexes" Error in a Sharded Cluster


## Description of the Error

The "Too Many Indexes" error in MongoDB, specifically within a sharded cluster, isn't a specific error message thrown by the MongoDB driver. Instead, it's a consequence of having an excessively high number of indexes across your sharded collections.  This leads to several performance problems:

* **Slow query execution:**  Searching and updating documents become significantly slower due to the overhead of managing numerous indexes.
* **Increased storage consumption:** Each index consumes storage space; too many indexes can lead to disk space exhaustion.
* **High write latency:**  Writing new documents takes longer as each index needs updating.
* **Increased replica set synchronization time:** Replicating changes to multiple replica sets gets slower.


This isn't solely an issue of the total number of indexes, but their relevance and efficient usage.  Poorly designed indexes can cause more harm than good.

## Fixing the Problem Step by Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes from a sharded collection.  The process involves identifying underutilized indexes, assessing their impact, and then carefully removing them. We'll illustrate with a simplified scenario.

**Step 1: Identify Underutilized Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.stats()` method to see index usage statistics.  This gives you information like the number of times each index was used in recent queries. A low `accesses` count might indicate an unnecessary index.

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.myCollection.stats()
```

Replace `myDatabase` and `myCollection` with your database and collection names.  Look for indexes with very low or zero `accesses`.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns**

Examine your application's queries using logs or monitoring tools (like MongoDB Ops Manager). Identify frequently used query patterns and ensure they are appropriately covered by existing indexes.   Often, a single compound index can effectively support multiple queries, eliminating the need for multiple individual indexes.


**Step 3:  Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you have identified indexes that are unused or redundant, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.  Always remove indexes one at a time and monitor performance to avoid unintended consequences.

```javascript
// Replace <index_name> with the actual index name to remove
db.myCollection.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

You can get the index name from the output of `db.myCollection.getIndexes()`

```javascript
db.myCollection.getIndexes().forEach(index => printjson(index))
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing an index, monitor query performance using profiling or other monitoring tools.  Ensure the removal doesn't negatively impact crucial queries.  If you observe performance degradation, restore the index and reconsider your optimization strategy.  You may need to create different, more efficient indexes.


## Explanation

The key to avoiding "Too Many Indexes" issues is proactive index management.  Avoid creating indexes without a clear understanding of their usage in frequently executed queries.  Compound indexes are often more efficient than multiple single-field indexes. Always analyze query patterns and index usage statistics to make informed decisions about which indexes to keep and which to remove.   Remember to perform these actions in a controlled manner, carefully monitoring the performance of your application before and after each index manipulation.
