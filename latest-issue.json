[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a card element that visually resembles a 3D card using only Tailwind CSS.  The effect will be achieved through shadows, subtle transformations, and color gradients.  No actual 3D transforms (like `perspective` and `rotate`) will be used, maintaining compatibility across browsers.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a rectangular element with a slightly raised appearance.  This will be primarily achieved using box shadows.  A subtle gradient will be added to give it depth and a more polished look.  The text content within the card will be clearly visible and styled appropriately.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-gray-500/50 relative overflow-hidden\">\n  <div class=\"absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100 to-indigo-100 opacity-20 blur-lg\"></div>\n  <div class=\"p-6\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\">Featured Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      This is a sample text for a featured card. You can customize this text to your liking.\n    </p>\n    <button class=\"mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n      Learn More\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-w-sm`**: Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* **`bg-white`**: Sets the background color to white.\n* **`rounded-lg`**: Adds rounded corners.\n* **`shadow-2xl shadow-gray-500/50`**: Applies a large box shadow with a gray color and 50% opacity, creating the raised effect. The `/50` part controls the opacity of the shadow.\n* **`relative`**: Makes the card a relative container for absolute positioning of the gradient.\n* **`overflow-hidden`**: Prevents the gradient from overflowing the card boundaries.\n* **`absolute inset-0`**: Positions the gradient element to cover the entire card.\n* **`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100 to-indigo-100`**: Creates a gradient from light blue to light indigo going from top-left to bottom-right.\n* **`opacity-20 blur-lg`**: Sets the opacity and blur for a subtle, soft gradient effect.\n* **`p-6`**: Adds padding to the inner content.\n* **`text-xl font-bold mb-2`**: Styles the card title.\n* **`text-gray-700 text-base`**: Styles the card body text.\n* **`mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`**: Styles the button.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  This is the official documentation for Tailwind CSS, a comprehensive resource for learning about all its utilities.\n* **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:** Search for \"Tailwind CSS cheat sheet\" on Google; many helpful cheat sheets are available to quickly reference the utility classes.\n* **Understanding CSS Box Shadows:** Search for \"CSS box-shadow\" on Google or MDN Web Docs for a detailed explanation of the `box-shadow` property.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
