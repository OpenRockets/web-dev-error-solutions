# üêû CSS Challenge:  Fluid, Responsive Image Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a responsive image card using Tailwind CSS. The card should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, maintaining a visually appealing aspect ratio for the image.  We'll focus on clean, semantic HTML and concise Tailwind classes for styling.

## Description of the Styling

The image card will feature:

* **Responsive Image:** The image will scale proportionally with the container, preventing distortion.
* **Rounded Corners:**  Gentle rounded corners for a softer look.
* **Shadow:** A subtle box shadow for visual depth.
* **Padding:** Internal padding to create breathing room around the image.
* **Hover Effect:** On hover, the card will subtly scale up, adding an interactive element.

## Explanation

* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** Centers the card horizontally and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.
* **`rounded overflow-hidden`:** Adds rounded corners and hides any overflow from the image.
* **`shadow-lg hover:shadow-2xl`:**  Applies a box shadow and enhances it on hover.
* **`hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out`:** Creates the hover scaling effect with smooth transitions.
* **`w-full h-auto` (image):** Makes the image responsive by taking the full width of its container while maintaining its aspect ratio.
* **Tailwind classes within the `<div>`:**  These style the text content within the card.
