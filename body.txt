## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and consume excessive disk space.  Adding an index creates overhead during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because the index needs to be updated every time a document is modified.  Too many indexes increase this overhead, leading to slower write speeds and potentially impacting overall database performance.  This is especially problematic with high-write-volume applications.  The symptoms often include slow insert/update times, high CPU utilization by the `mongod` process, and increased storage usage.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields `name` (string), `price` (number), `category` (string), and `description` (string). We initially created indexes on all four fields individually, leading to performance issues.

**Step 1: Analyze Existing Indexes**

First, identify existing indexes using the `db.products.getIndexes()` command.

```javascript
use myDatabase
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  Look for indexes that are rarely used or that are redundant (e.g., indexes covering subsets of another index).


**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the MongoDB profiler or server logs to analyze query patterns. This helps pinpoint which indexes are actively used and which are not.  You can use the `db.system.profile.find()` command to check the profiler. If you don't see frequent usage of an index, it's a candidate for removal.

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Remove unused indexes using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command.  For example, if `db.products.getIndexes()` shows an index on the `description` field that's not being utilized:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } )
```

**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes**

Sometimes, you might need to combine multiple indexes into a compound index to optimize multiple query patterns.  For example, if you frequently query by `category` and then by `price`, a compound index would be better:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```
This single index can support queries filtering by `category` or `category` and `price`. Avoid creating indexes that are too broad.


**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing or modifying indexes, monitor the performance of write operations using metrics and tools provided by MongoDB, such as the MongoDB Compass monitoring tools or performance analyzers. Observe write times, CPU usage, and storage usage to ensure the improvements.


## Explanation

Over-indexing creates a write performance penalty because MongoDB needs to update all indexes every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  The more indexes, the greater the overhead.  This overhead can easily outweigh the performance gains from faster query times, especially in write-heavy applications.  A well-designed indexing strategy focuses on creating only the necessary indexes for frequently executed queries, favoring compound indexes over multiple single-field indexes where possible.  Regularly reviewing and optimizing indexes is essential for maintaining optimal MongoDB performance.
