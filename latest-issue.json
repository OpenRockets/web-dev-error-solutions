[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating an animated expanding card using pure CSS.  The card will subtly expand on hover, providing a visually appealing user interaction. We'll use CSS3 transitions and transforms to achieve this effect.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a simple rectangle with a background color, some padding, and text content.  The key styling is the application of CSS transitions and transforms to the `transform` property on hover. This will smoothly scale the card up slightly when the mouse hovers over it.  We'll also add a subtle box-shadow to enhance the 3D effect.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition on hover */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand slightly on hover */\n  box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Stronger shadow on hover */\n}\n\n/*Example content styling*/\n.card h2{\n  margin-top:0;\n}\n.card p{\n  margin-bottom:0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h2>Expanding Card</h2>\n  <p>This is an example of an expanding card created using only CSS.  Hover over the card to see the animation.</p>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line is crucial. It tells the browser to smoothly animate any changes to the `transform` property over 0.3 seconds, using an \"ease-in-out\" timing function for a natural feel.\n\n* **`transform: scale(1.05);`**: This line, applied on hover, scales the card up by 5% in both dimensions.  You can adjust the `1.05` value to control the expansion amount.\n\n* **`box-shadow`**: The box-shadow property adds a subtle shadow, enhancing the 3D appearance of the card. The shadow's intensity is also increased on hover for a more dramatic effect.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Box-shadow:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
