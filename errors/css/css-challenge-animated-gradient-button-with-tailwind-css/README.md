# üêû CSS Challenge:  Animated Gradient Button with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating an attractive button with an animated gradient background using Tailwind CSS. The button will have a smooth transition between two colors when hovered over.  This example uses Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, but the core concept can be adapted to plain CSS3.


**Description of the Styling:**

The button will be rectangular with rounded corners.  The background will be a linear gradient transitioning from a teal color to a light blue color. On hover, the gradient will reverse, smoothly transitioning from light blue to teal.  The text within the button will be white, ensuring good contrast against the background gradients.

      Click Me!
    </button>
  </div>
</body>

```

**Explanation:**

* **`bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-500 to-blue-200`**: This applies a linear gradient from teal-500 (a dark teal) to blue-200 (a light blue), with the gradient going from left to right (`to-r`).
* **`hover:bg-gradient-to-l hover:from-blue-200 hover:to-teal-500`**: This sets the styles for the hover effect.  `to-l` reverses the gradient direction, and the `from` and `to` values are swapped to create the animation.
* **`text-white font-bold py-2 px-6 rounded-lg`**: This styles the text (white, bold), padding, and rounded corners.
* **`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`**: This adds a smooth transition with a duration of 300 milliseconds and an ease-in-out timing function.
