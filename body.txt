## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB, especially in larger databases, is having too many indexes. While indexes dramatically improve query performance, excessive indexing can negatively impact write performance, storage space consumption, and overall database efficiency.  MongoDB can become slow at inserting, updating, and deleting documents as the index maintenance overhead grows. This can manifest as slower application response times and increased resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).  The symptom is often sluggish write operations without obviously slow read operations.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products` within a database named `mydatabase`.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use mydatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array of index specifications.  Pay close attention to the `key` field, which shows the fields indexed and their order (ascending or descending).  Analyze which indexes are frequently used by your application's queries and which are seldom or never utilized.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

MongoDB Profiler (explained below) is invaluable here. However, for a quick assessment, you can use the MongoDB Compass GUI (or similar tools) to monitor query performance and correlate it with the existing indexes.  If you notice a significant slow down on insertion or update operations this is an indicator of too many indexes.

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified underutilized indexes, drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  Let's assume you want to remove an index on the `sku` field:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { sku: 1 } )
```
Replace `{ sku: 1 }` with the actual index specification you want to remove from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`.  The `1` indicates ascending order; use `-1` for descending.  If the index is compound, include all fields within the curly brackets: `{sku: 1, category: -1}`

**Step 4: Verify Index Removal**

After dropping an index, re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm it's been successfully removed.

**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Observe write operation times and overall database resource usage.  Use the profiling level to monitor which indexes are used most frequently for better understanding:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enables profiling for all operations
// ... perform operations ...
db.system.profile.find() // Review the profiling data
db.setProfilingLevel(0); // Disables profiling
```

## Explanation

Having too many indexes leads to performance bottlenecks because every write operation triggers index updates across all indexes. The write operation needs to update every single index impacting performance and resource consumption (CPU, IO, Memory).  As the number of indexes and the size of the data grows, this overhead becomes substantial.  A good balance is essential: enough indexes to speed up common queries, but not so many that they hinder write performance.
