[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a card with a subtle 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this using box-shadow and subtle transformations to simulate depth and perspective.  This is a beginner-friendly challenge, ideal for practicing Tailwind's utility-first approach.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a clean, minimalist design.  It will feature a subtle drop shadow to give it a lifted appearance. We'll use a slightly larger `box-shadow` on hover to enhance the 3D effect.  The card will also include a simple title and a paragraph of text.  We'll leverage Tailwind's responsive design capabilities to ensure the card adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>3D Card with Tailwind CSS</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n  <div class=\"container mx-auto p-8\">\n    <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition duration-300 transform hover:-translate-y-1\">\n      <div class=\"p-6\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\">Card Title</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n          This is a sample paragraph of text for the card. You can add more content here as needed.  This demonstrates a basic 3D card effect using Tailwind CSS.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`container mx-auto p-8`:** Centers the card horizontally on the page and adds padding.\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card, ensuring responsiveness.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg`:**  Sets the background color to white and adds rounded corners.\n* **`shadow-md hover:shadow-lg`:** Applies a medium shadow by default and a larger shadow on hover, creating the 3D effect.\n* **`transition duration-300 transform hover:-translate-y-1`:** Adds a smooth transition for the hover effect, subtly lifting the card on hover.\n* **`p-6`:** Adds padding to the content within the card.\n* **`text-xl font-bold mb-2`:** Styles the title.\n* **`text-gray-700 text-base`:** Styles the paragraph text.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official documentation for Tailwind CSS.  This is an excellent resource for learning about all the available utility classes.\n* **CSS Box Shadow Tutorial:** Search for \"CSS box-shadow tutorial\" on Google or YouTube for a deeper understanding of the `box-shadow` property and its parameters.\n* **Understanding CSS Transforms:** Search for \"CSS transforms tutorial\"  on Google or YouTube to learn about `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, etc. and how they can create effects like this.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
