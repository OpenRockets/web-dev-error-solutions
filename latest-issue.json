[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive product card using Tailwind CSS. The goal is to build a card that showcases product information clearly and attractively, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for rapid development and maintainable styling.\n\n## Description of the Styling:\n\nThe card will feature:\n\n* **A product image:** Occupying the top portion of the card.\n* **Product title:** A concise and prominent heading.\n* **Product description:** A short paragraph summarizing the product.\n* **Price:** Clearly displayed with appropriate styling.\n* **Add to cart button:** A call-to-action button for users.\n* **Responsive design:**  The layout should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).\n* **Modern aesthetics:**  Using a clean, contemporary design language.\n\n\n## Full Code:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700\">\n  <a href=\"#\">\n    <img class=\"p-4 rounded-t-lg\" src=\"https://flowbite.com/docs/images/blog/image-1.jpg\" alt=\"product image\" />\n  </a>\n  <div class=\"p-5\">\n    <a href=\"#\">\n      <h5 class=\"mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">Noteworthy Tech</h5>\n    </a>\n    <p class=\"mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400\">Here are the biggest enterprise technology acquisitions of 2023 so far, and what they mean for the industry.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400\">\n        This is an example of a product description, which can be used to provide more information about the product. You can add as much information as you want.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n      <span class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">$49</span>\n      <a href=\"#\" class=\"text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800\">Add to cart</a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\nThis code uses Tailwind CSS classes to style the card. Let's break down some key aspects:\n\n* `max-w-sm`: Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.\n* `rounded-lg`: Adds rounded corners.\n* `shadow-md`: Applies a subtle shadow.\n*  `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, etc.:  These control text size, weight, and color.  Tailwind offers a vast array of such classes.\n* `flex items-center justify-between`: This creates a flexbox container to arrange the price and button horizontally.\n* Dark mode support: classes like `dark:bg-gray-800` and `dark:text-white` ensure the card adapts to dark mode.\n\n## Resources to Learn More:\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Official Website:** [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The primary resource for documentation, tutorials, and examples.\n* **Tailwind CSS Playgrounds:** Numerous online playgrounds allow you to experiment with Tailwind classes interactively.

You can customize it further by adding more features, changing colors, and adjusting the layout to fit your specific needs.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
