This challenge involves creating a modern-looking card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, a title, a short description, and a button.  We'll focus on clean styling and responsive design.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, minimalist aesthetic.  It will utilize Tailwind's pre-defined utility classes for rapid development. We'll aim for a card that's visually appealing and adapts gracefully to different screen sizes. The card will have rounded corners, shadows, and a subtle hover effect.

**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  <img class="w-full" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x300" alt="Sunset in the mountains">
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Mountain Sunset</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">

```

**Explanation:**

* **`max-w-sm`**: Limits the card's maximum width to small size.
* **`rounded`**: Adds rounded corners.
* **`overflow-hidden`**: Prevents content from overflowing the card.
* **`shadow-lg`**: Applies a large shadow.
* **`w-full` (in the `img` tag)**: Makes the image occupy the full width of its container.
* **`px-6 py-4`**: Adds padding to the content area.
* **`font-bold text-xl mb-2`**: Styles the title.
* **`text-gray-700 text-base`**: Styles the description text.
* **`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`**: Styles the button with a blue background, hover effect, and white text.
