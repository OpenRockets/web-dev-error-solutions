## Description of the Error

One common problem developers face in MongoDB is having too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation, especially during write operations.  Every index consumes storage space and adds overhead during inserts, updates, and deletes.  Excessive indexing can result in slower write performance, increased storage costs, and ultimately, a less responsive application.  MongoDB's write operations must update all relevant indexes, making many indexes a bottleneck. The symptoms might include slow inserts, updates, or deletes, and high CPU usage during write operations.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates identifying and addressing excessive indexing on a collection named `products` with many unnecessary indexes.  We'll focus on using the `db.collection.stats()` command and selectively dropping unnecessary indexes.


**Step 1: Identify Over-Indexed Collections**

First, we need to identify collections with a potentially excessive number of indexes.  We use the `db.collection.stats()` command to get collection statistics, including the number of indexes.

```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB database
use your_database_name;

// Get stats for the 'products' collection
db.products.stats();
```

This will output a JSON document containing various statistics, including `indexSizes` (total size of all indexes) and information on individual indexes within the `indexes` array. Analyze the output to assess if the number of indexes is excessive compared to the collection's usage patterns.  A large `indexSizes` relative to the `dataSize` might indicate a problem.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

We need to understand which indexes are frequently used and which are seldom or never used. This often requires analyzing your application's queries using the MongoDB profiler or by examining your application logs.   The profiler will show which indexes are used for each query.  If an index isn't used, it is a candidate for removal.

```javascript
// Enable the profiler (adjust level as needed; 2 is a good starting point)
db.setProfilingLevel(2)

// ... run your application queries ...

// Retrieve profiling data
db.system.profile.find().sort({ $natural: -1 }).limit(10)  //Review recent entries
```

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes with low or no usage, you can drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.  Remember to replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index.  You can find the index name in the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`

```javascript
// Drop an index (replace with your index name)
db.products.dropIndex("unnecessary_index_name_1")
db.products.dropIndex("unnecessary_index_name_2")
```


**Step 4: Re-evaluate and Monitor**

After dropping indexes, re-run `db.products.stats()` to check the impact on storage and index size. Continue to monitor performance metrics (write operations, CPU usage, etc.) to ensure improvements. Consider using a monitoring tool like MongoDB Compass to visualize index usage over time.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes leads to increased overhead during write operations. Every write needs to update all relevant indexes, making write performance increasingly slower as the number of indexes grows.  The storage cost for indexes also increases, resulting in higher operational costs.  Careful analysis of query patterns and index usage is crucial to ensure only essential indexes are retained. Dropping unnecessary indexes reduces the write workload and storage consumption, thereby improving overall database performance.
