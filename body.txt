## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly improve query performance, creating too many indexes or inappropriate indexes can lead to substantial performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This happens because every write operation must update all affected indexes, and excessive indexes increase this overhead significantly.  The database spends more time managing indexes than processing queries, leading to slow application performance and potentially impacting scalability.  The slowdown can be subtle and hard to detect initially, manifesting as slow write speeds or increased latency, rather than outright errors.

## Step-by-Step Code Example and Fixing

This example demonstrates the problem and its solution using the `movies` collection with a simplified structure.  We'll assume we have a collection with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "title": "Movie Title",
  "year": 2023,
  "genre": "Action",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "actors": ["Actor A", "Actor B"]
}
```


**Problem Scenario (Over-indexing):**

Let's say we create indexes on all fields:

```javascript
db.movies.createIndex( { title: 1 } );
db.movies.createIndex( { year: 1 } );
db.movies.createIndex( { genre: 1 } );
db.movies.createIndex( { rating: 1 } );
db.movies.createIndex( { actors: 1 } ); // Array field index
```

Now, every insertion and update will update all five indexes, slowing down write operations considerably, especially with a large dataset.


**Solution (Strategic Indexing):**

The key is to only create indexes on fields frequently used in query filters (WHERE clauses).  Analyze your application's queries to identify the most frequent filter conditions.  For example, if most queries filter by `title` and `year`, these are the only fields that need indexes.  Furthermore, compound indexes can be more efficient than separate indexes:

```javascript
// Remove unnecessary indexes
db.movies.dropIndex( { genre: 1 } );
db.movies.dropIndex( { rating: 1 } );
db.movies.dropIndex( { actors: 1 } );


// Create strategic indexes
db.movies.createIndex( { title: 1, year: 1 } ); // Compound index
```

This compound index effectively covers queries filtering on either `title`, `year`, or both.  We've reduced the index count and improved write performance. We should consider creating a separate index only for `actors` if there are very frequent queries based on the actors.



## Explanation

Over-indexing is a classic example of optimizing prematurely.  It's crucial to profile your application's query patterns *before* creating indexes haphazardly. MongoDB's profiling tools and query logs are invaluable for identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding which indexes are truly necessary.  Furthermore, understand the different types of indexes (e.g., single-field, compound, text, geospatial) and their suitability for specific query types.  Careful index design requires consideration of both query efficiency and the impact on write performance.
