# üêû CSS Challenge:  Responsive Social Media Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on building a responsive social media card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, a title, a short description, and a button. The layout should adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.


**Description of the Styling:**

The social media card will use a clean and modern design. The image will be placed at the top, followed by the title, description, and finally a call-to-action button.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for easy styling and responsiveness. The card will have rounded corners, padding, and a subtle shadow for visual appeal.  The responsiveness will ensure the card looks good on both large desktops and smaller mobile screens.

**Full Code:**

**Explanation:**

* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** This centers the card horizontally and adds padding.
* **`max-w-sm`:**  This limits the card's maximum width for better responsiveness.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`:** This sets the background color, rounded corners, shadow, and padding for the card.
* **`rounded-t-lg`:** Applies rounded top corners to the image.
* **`text-xl font-bold mb-2`:** Styles the title.
* **`text-gray-700 mb-4`:** Styles the description.
* **`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`:** Styles the button with hover effect.  The `hover:` modifier changes the style on hover.
* **`w-full`:** Makes the image take up the full width of its container.
* **`mb-4`:** Adds margin to the bottom of elements for spacing.
