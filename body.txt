This document addresses a common problem in MongoDB: having too many indexes, which can negatively impact write performance and storage space.  While indexes are crucial for efficient query performance, an excessive number can lead to performance bottlenecks.

## Description of the Error

The error itself isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance degradation.  You might observe slow write operations (inserts, updates, deletes), increased storage space usage, and overall decreased database responsiveness.  The root cause is often the creation of too many indexes, especially unnecessary or redundant ones.  MongoDB spends time maintaining these indexes on every write operation, leading to performance overhead.  Monitoring tools might reveal slow write times or high disk I/O related to index operations.

## Fixing Steps (Code Example)

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products`:

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array containing information about each index, including the fields involved and their order.  Examine the output carefully to identify redundant or unused indexes.


**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified unnecessary indexes, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to drop (found in the output of `getIndexes()`). If you are unsure of the index name, you can use the index specification instead.

**Example 1: Dropping by name:**

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("myRedundantIndex");
```

**Example 2: Dropping by specification:**

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { "productCategory": 1, "price": -1 } ); // Drops index on productCategory ASC and price DESC

```

**Step 3: Verify Index Removal**

After dropping an index, re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm its removal.


**Step 4: (Optional) Re-evaluate Indexing Strategy**

After removing unnecessary indexes, it's crucial to re-evaluate your indexing strategy. Ensure you have indexes on the fields frequently used in query filters (`$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc.) and sort operations.  Consider compound indexes to optimize queries involving multiple fields.

## Explanation

MongoDB indexes work similarly to indexes in relational databases. They are special data structures that speed up data retrieval.  However, maintaining these structures requires additional resources.  Each write operation requires updating all indexes.  Therefore, too many indexes, especially those rarely used, lead to:

* **Increased write times:** Updating many indexes takes time.
* **Larger database size:** Indexes consume storage space.
* **Increased I/O:**  Frequent index updates increase disk access.


By strategically dropping unnecessary indexes, you improve write performance and reduce database size, resulting in a more responsive and efficient database.
