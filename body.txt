## Description of the Error

The `$where` operator in MongoDB provides a way to filter documents based on JavaScript expressions.  However, using `$where` can significantly impact query performance, often leading to slow response times and impacting application scalability. This is because `$where` performs a full collection scan on the server-side, bypassing indexes completely.  This becomes a major issue with large collections.  Even simple queries that could be optimized with proper indexing become slow and inefficient when implemented using `$where`.  The performance degradation is especially noticeable with increasing dataset size.

## Fixing Step-by-Step Code

Let's illustrate with a scenario:  We have a collection called `products` with fields `price` and `category`. We want to find all products where the price is more than twice the average price of products in the "Electronics" category.  A naive (and incorrect) approach using `$where` might look like this:

**Inefficient (using `$where`):**

```javascript
db.products.find( { $where: "this.price > 2 * db.products.aggregate([ { $match: { category: 'Electronics' } }, { $group: { _id: null, avgPrice: { $avg: '$price' } } }]).next().avgPrice" } )
```

This is inefficient because it executes a separate aggregation pipeline for every document in the `products` collection, resulting in a massive performance hit.

**Efficient Solution (using Aggregation Pipeline):**

The correct and far more efficient approach leverages MongoDB's aggregation pipeline capabilities:

```javascript
db.products.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      let: { category: "$category" },
      pipeline: [
        {
          $match: {
            $expr: {
              $and: [
                { $eq: ["$category", "$$category"] },
                { $eq: ["$category", "Electronics"] }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        { $group: { _id: null, avgPrice: { $avg: "$price" } } }
      ],
      as: "avgElectronicsPrice"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$avgElectronicsPrice" },
  { $match: { "price": { $gt: { $multiply: [2, "$avgElectronicsPrice.avgPrice"] } } } },
  { $project: { _id: 1, price: 1, category: 1, avgElectronicsPrice: 0 } } //Optional: Removing unnecessary fields
])
```

This approach efficiently calculates the average price of "Electronics" products once and then filters the results accordingly.


## Explanation

The inefficient `$where` example forces MongoDB to execute a complex operation for each document. The efficient aggregation pipeline approach calculates the necessary aggregate value (average price) only once, then applies the filter, leveraging indexes where applicable (depending on the indexes created on the `products` collection). This drastically reduces the execution time, especially for large datasets.  Avoid using `$where` when possible. Always explore alternatives using the aggregation framework or proper indexing.
