# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB stemming from an excessive number of indexes. While indexes are crucial for query optimization, having too many can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead.  This example focuses on a scenario where multiple indexes are unnecessarily created on the same field, leading to write slowdowns.

**Description of the Error:**

When creating many indexes on a single field or frequently performing updates on collections with numerous indexes, MongoDB experiences increased write times. This is because every write operation necessitates updating all affected indexes.  The `mongod` logs might show increased write latency or slow response times during update operations.  You might observe that inserts and updates are much slower than expected, disproportionate to the volume of data.

**Scenario:**  Let's say we have a collection named `products` with a field `category`.  We've mistakenly created multiple indexes on this field, potentially with varying sorts:

* An ascending index: `{"category": 1}`
* A descending index: `{"category": -1}`
* A compound index: `{"category": 1, "price": -1}` (where `price` is another field)


This redundancy is wasteful. A single index (likely the compound one if `price` is often used in queries) would suffice for efficient querying on `category`.


**Step-by-Step Code for Fixing the Problem:**

We will use the MongoDB shell to identify and remove unnecessary indexes.

**1. Identify Existing Indexes:**

```javascript
use products; // Select the database
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command returns a list of all indexes on the `products` collection.  Look for multiple indexes that only differ by sorting direction or are partially redundant (e.g., a simple index and a compound index which include the simple index's fields as a prefix).

**2. Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on the output from step 1, let's assume we want to remove the ascending and descending single field indexes on `category`, keeping only the compound index.  The commands would be:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"category": 1})
db.products.dropIndex({"category": -1})
```

**3. Verify Remaining Indexes:**

After dropping the indexes, re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm that only the desired indexes remain.


**Explanation:**

Removing redundant indexes significantly reduces the overhead associated with write operations.  Each write operation only needs to update the necessary indexes, improving performance and efficiency. The key is to strategically design indexes that serve the most frequent query patterns without creating excessive redundancy.  Prioritize compound indexes that serve multiple query criteria over single-field indexes if multiple fields are regularly used in queries.

**Best Practices:**

* Carefully analyze query patterns before creating indexes.
* Use the `explain()` method to analyze query performance and identify opportunities for index optimization.
* Regularly review and prune unnecessary indexes.
* Consider the trade-off between read and write performance when designing your indexing strategy.
