[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card element that simulates a 3D effect using only CSS and Tailwind CSS. We'll achieve this through clever use of box-shadow, transforms, and Tailwind's utility classes for rapid development.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a rectangular element with a subtle 3D effect created by a carefully crafted box-shadow.  We'll add a gradient background for visual interest and use Tailwind classes for consistent spacing and padding.  The text content will be clearly visible and styled appropriately. The card will be slightly lifted from the background, enhancing the 3D illusion.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500\">\n  <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/500x300\" alt=\"Sunset in the mountains\">\n  <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n    <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Card Title</div>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      This is a longer card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to\n      additional content. This content is a bit longer.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"px-6 pt-4 pb-2\">\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2\">#photography</span>\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2\">#travel</span>\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700\">#mountain</span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-w-sm`**:  Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* **`rounded overflow-hidden`**: Creates rounded corners and prevents content from overflowing.\n* **`shadow-lg`**: Applies a large box-shadow to simulate depth.  This is crucial for the 3D effect.\n* **`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`**: Creates a gradient background from blue to purple.  You can change these colors as you like.\n* **`px-6 py-4`**: Adds padding to the content area.\n* **`font-bold text-xl mb-2`**: Styles the card title.\n* **`text-gray-700 text-base`**: Styles the paragraph text.\n* **`inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2`**: Styles the tags.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  -  The official Tailwind CSS documentation is an excellent resource for learning about its utility classes and features.\n* **CSS Box-Shadow Property:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Understand how to use the `box-shadow` property effectively.\n* **CSS Gradients:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient) - Learn more about creating linear gradients in CSS.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
