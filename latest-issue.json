[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a visually appealing card element that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  The card will have a subtle shadow, a slightly raised appearance, and a rounded design.  This is a great exercise for practicing Tailwind's utility-first approach and its responsive design capabilities.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a rectangular container with:\n\n*   A light gray background.\n*   Rounded corners (using `rounded-lg`).\n*   A subtle drop shadow to create the 3D effect (`shadow-md`).\n*   Padding to provide internal spacing.\n*   A dark gray text for the title and body content.\n*   Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded-lg shadow-md bg-gray-100 p-6 mx-auto my-10\">\n  <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2\">Card Title</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n    This is a sample card with a 3D-like effect created using only Tailwind CSS.\n    You can easily customize the styling and content to fit your needs.\n  </p>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `max-w-sm`: Sets a maximum width for the card, making it responsive.\n*   `rounded-lg`: Adds large rounded corners.\n*   `shadow-md`: Applies a medium shadow, giving the 3D impression.\n*   `bg-gray-100`: Sets a light gray background color.\n*   `p-6`: Adds padding of 6 units on all sides.\n*   `mx-auto`: Centers the card horizontally.\n*   `my-10`: Adds margin of 10 units top and bottom.\n*   `text-xl`, `font-bold`, `text-gray-800`: Styles the title.\n*   `text-gray-700`, `text-base`: Styles the paragraph text.\n\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n*   **Tailwind CSS Official Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  This is the primary resource for learning Tailwind CSS.
