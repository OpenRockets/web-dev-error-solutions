# üêû Overcoming the "too many indexes" problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

The "too many indexes" problem in MongoDB isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance bottleneck stemming from having an excessive number of indexes on a collection.  While indexes significantly speed up queries, creating too many can lead to:

* **Increased write operations:**  Each write operation (insert, update, delete) needs to update all relevant indexes, slowing down data modification.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes consume disk space, potentially leading to higher storage costs and slower read operations due to increased I/O.
* **Slower query execution:**  Although indexes improve query performance, an excessively large number can actually make query planning slower as MongoDB needs to consider many options.  This can lead to suboptimal query plans.


## Fixing the Problem: A Step-by-Step Approach

This example demonstrates how to identify and reduce excessive indexes on a collection named "products" within a database called "eCommerce".  We'll assume you have a MongoDB instance running and access via the mongo shell.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

```javascript
use eCommerce;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all indexes on the `products` collection.  Pay attention to the index keys and the number of indexes.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

The `db.collection.stats()` command provides information on index usage. However, a deeper analysis usually requires monitoring tools or profiling queries to determine actual index usage and identify underutilized indexes. For instance, you could examine the MongoDB profiler logs to see which indexes were used and the time taken for each query execution.

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```

This provides statistics, but more comprehensive monitoring tools are necessary for true understanding of index usage patterns.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

After analyzing index usage, remove any indexes that are not significantly contributing to query performance.  Let's assume that the index `{ "category": 1, "price": 1 }` is rarely used. To remove it:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({ "category": 1, "price": 1 })
```

**Step 4: Re-evaluate and Iterate**

After removing indexes, monitor the performance of your application.  You may need to iterate through steps 2 and 3 several times to achieve optimal indexing.  Consider using a combination of compound indexes that address frequently used query patterns instead of multiple single-field indexes.  This helps avoid unnecessary index updates.

**Step 5 (Optional): Create a Compound Index (More Efficient Approach)**

Instead of creating numerous single-field indexes, consider a compound index that covers more query patterns. For example, if you often query by `category` and then by `price`, a compound index is more efficient:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: -1 } )
```


## Explanation

The key is to balance the benefits of indexing with the overhead of maintaining many indexes.  Excessive indexes lead to slower writes, increased storage, and potentially slower query planning due to the complexity in selecting the best index.  A thorough understanding of your query patterns and careful index selection are crucial.  Use appropriate monitoring tools to analyze index usage and inform the removal or creation of indexes. A good strategy is to focus on the most frequently executed queries and create indexes to optimize their performance. This often involves creating fewer, but more comprehensive, compound indexes.
