This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using only CSS. We'll achieve this using shadows, gradients, and careful manipulation of box-shadow properties.  This solution utilizes plain CSS3, but similar effects can be achieved with Tailwind CSS by leveraging its utility classes.

**Description of the Styling:**

The goal is to create a card that appears to be slightly raised from the background.  This is accomplished primarily through strategic use of box-shadow. We'll also add a subtle gradient to enhance the depth and visual appeal.  The card will have rounded corners and a clean, modern design.

**Full Code (CSS):**

```css
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), -5px -5px 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7); /* Key for 3D effect */
  overflow: hidden; /* To ensure gradient doesn't overflow */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

.card-content h2 {
  margin-top: 0;
}

.card::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.5) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 100%); /* Subtle Gradient */
  z-index: -1; /* Place behind the card */
  opacity: 0.7;
}


```

**Full Code (HTML -  to use with the CSS above):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>3D Card</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h2>My 3D Card</h2>
      <p>This is a sample card with a 3D effect.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>

```

**Explanation:**

* **`box-shadow`:** This property is the core of the 3D effect.  We use two `box-shadow` values: one with positive offsets to simulate a lower shadow, and another with negative offsets to simulate a lighter, upper shadow.  Adjusting the blur radius (`10px`) controls the softness of the shadow.  The `rgba` values control the color and opacity.

* **`linear-gradient`:** The gradient adds a subtle highlight to the card, further enhancing the 3D illusion.  Experiment with different angles and colors to achieve varied effects.

* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents the gradient from extending beyond the card's borders.
