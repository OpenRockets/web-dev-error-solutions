[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing glassmorphism card using Tailwind CSS. Glassmorphism, a design trend, involves creating elements with a translucent, frosted glass effect.  We'll achieve this using Tailwind's utility classes for background, shadows, and border-radius.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a rectangular shape with a slightly blurred, translucent background.  It will have a subtle inner shadow to enhance the glass effect and a clean, modern look. We will use a dark background for the card's content to contrast with the lighter, translucent background.  The text within will be white for optimal readability.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Glassmorphism Card</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-800\">\n\n<div class=\"w-96 mx-auto mt-10 bg-white/20 backdrop-blur-lg rounded-xl p-6 shadow-xl shadow-gray-500/50\">\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4\">Glassmorphism Card</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-lg text-white\">This is a sample text inside the glassmorphism card.  You can customize this content as needed.</p>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `bg-white/20`: Sets the background color to white with 20% opacity, creating the translucent effect.\n* `backdrop-blur-lg`: Applies a large blur to the background, enhancing the glass effect.\n* `rounded-xl`: Adds extra-large rounded corners for a softer look.\n* `p-6`: Adds padding of 6 units (Tailwind's default unit is roughly 1rem or 16px).\n* `shadow-xl`:  Applies a large box shadow.\n* `shadow-gray-500/50`: Specifies the shadow color as gray-500 with 50% opacity for a subtle, realistic shadow.\n* `w-96`: Sets the width of the card to 96 units (adjust as needed).\n* `mx-auto`: Centers the card horizontally.\n* `mt-10`: Adds a margin top of 10 units.\n* `text-3xl`, `font-bold`, `text-white`, `text-lg`:  These classes style the heading and paragraph text.\n* `bg-gray-800`: Sets a dark gray background for the body to provide contrast.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  - The official documentation is an excellent resource for learning all about Tailwind CSS utility classes.\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Backgrounds and Borders:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - Learn more about CSS backgrounds and how to control opacity and blurring.\n* **Understanding Box Shadows:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Deep dive into the `box-shadow` property.\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
