## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating searchable structures, adding too many indexes can lead to performance degradation.  Write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) become slower because the database needs to update all indexes each time a document is modified.  This is especially problematic for frequently updated collections.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space, impacting storage costs and potentially slowing down general database operations.  The performance bottleneck might not always be immediately obvious, appearing only under high write loads or with complex query patterns.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with fields `category`, `name`, `price`, and `description`.  Initially, we created separate indexes on `category`, `name`, and `price`. This is an example of over-indexing, especially if queries rarely use all three fields together.

**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns**

Before removing any indexes, analyze your application's queries using MongoDB's profiling tools. This identifies frequently used queries and the fields accessed.  The `db.system.profile` collection is key to this analysis.  Here's how you can enable profiling and view the results:


```javascript
// Enable profiling level 2 (log all queries)
db.setProfilingLevel(2);

// ... run your application for a while ...

// View profiling data
db.system.profile.find().sort({$natural:-1}).limit(10);  //Shows last 10 queries
```

**Step 2: Identify Redundant or Underutilized Indexes**

Examine the profiling data.  If you discover that indexes are not being used (for example, an index on `description` isn't hit), or if multiple indexes cover the same query patterns, they are candidates for removal.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on the analysis, remove the redundant indexes using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method. For example, if the `name` index is not heavily used:

```javascript
// Drop the index on the 'name' field
db.products.dropIndex("name_1"); // Assuming the index name is "name_1". You can see the index name with db.products.getIndexes()
```

**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes**

Consider compound indexes for queries that use multiple fields. A compound index on `{"category": 1, "price": 1}` is more efficient than separate indexes on `category` and `price` if your queries frequently filter by both.


```javascript
// Create a compound index on category and price
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } );
```

**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing or optimizing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Use MongoDB's monitoring tools or your application's logging to track query times and write operation speeds.  Ensure that performance improves after these changes.

## Explanation

Over-indexing impacts write performance because every index needs updating on every write operation (insert, update, delete). This overhead becomes significant with many indexes and high write volumes. It also increases storage usage, leading to higher costs and potentially slower database operations. Careful analysis of query patterns is crucial to create only the necessary indexes and avoid performance problems.
