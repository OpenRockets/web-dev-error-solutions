# üêû CSS Challenge:  Responsive Image Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a responsive image card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, a title, and a short description, all neatly arranged and adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient and concise styling.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, modern look. The image will take up the majority of the card's space, maintaining its aspect ratio. The title will be prominently displayed below the image, and a concise description will follow.  The card will have rounded corners, padding, and a subtle shadow for visual appeal.  Responsiveness is key‚Äîthe card should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, preventing content overflow or awkward layouts.


**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-white">
  <img class="w-full" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x300" alt="Sunset in the Mountains">
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Sunset over the Lake</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
    <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2">#photography</span>
    <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2">#nature</span>
    <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700">#landscape</span>
  </div>
</div>
```
