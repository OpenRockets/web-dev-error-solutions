## Description of the Error

The "Too many open files" error in MongoDB typically occurs when your MongoDB instance exhausts the operating system's limit on the number of simultaneously open files.  This often happens when your application performs many concurrent operations, particularly reads, without properly closing cursors or connections.  MongoDB itself might also be affected by a low system-wide file limit. The error manifests differently depending on the operating system and the MongoDB driver used but generally involves a connection failure or performance degradation.  It can even lead to the MongoDB process crashing.


## Fixing the "Too Many Open Files" Error Step-by-Step

This example focuses on increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux and ensuring proper cursor closure in a Python application using the PyMongo driver.  Adaptations are needed for other operating systems and programming languages.

**Step 1: Increase the system-wide file descriptor limit (Linux)**

First, check your current limit using:

```bash
ulimit -n
```

The output shows your current soft and hard limits. To increase them (requires root privileges), use:

```bash
sudo ulimit -n 65535  # Set to 65535, adjust as needed.
```

This temporarily sets the limit for your current session.  To make it permanent, you'll need to modify `/etc/security/limits.conf` (or a similar file depending on your distribution):

```
# Add the following line, replacing <username> with your username:
<username>    hard    nofile    65535
<username>    soft    nofile    65535
```

After saving, log out and back in (or reboot) for the changes to take effect.  Verify with `ulimit -n` again.


**Step 2: Ensure proper cursor closure in your Python application (PyMongo)**

Improperly handling cursors is a major contributor to this error.  Always ensure you explicitly close your cursors using a `finally` block or context manager:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

try:
    cursor = collection.find({})
    for document in cursor:
        # Process each document
        print(document)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    if cursor:
        cursor.close()  #Crucial step: close the cursor!
    client.close()       #Close the client connection
```

**Step 3:  Using context managers (recommended):**

Context managers provide a more elegant and safer way to manage resources:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

try:
    with collection.find({}) as cursor:
        for document in cursor:
            # Process each document
            print(document)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    client.close() # Client is automatically closed when exiting the 'with' block.


```
This approach guarantees that the cursor will be closed, even if exceptions are raised.


## Explanation

The "Too Many Open Files" error arises from exceeding the operating system's limit on simultaneously open file descriptors.  Each open database connection, network socket, and file (including MongoDB cursors) consumes a file descriptor. When this limit is reached, new connections are refused, causing errors.  Step 1 addresses the system-level limit, while Step 2 addresses the application-level resource management problem.  Properly closing cursors and connections releases file descriptors, preventing the error. The context manager approach in Step 3 further enhances resource management and reduces the risk of forgetting to close resources.
