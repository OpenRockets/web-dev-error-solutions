[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers face in MongoDB: performance degradation due to excessive queries that arise from improper indexing.  This often manifests as slow application response times and high server load.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen a MongoDB application experiences many queries that don't utilize indexes effectively, the database has to perform full collection scans to find matching documents. This is significantly slower than using an index, especially for large collections.  The error itself isn't a specific error message but rather a symptom observed through performance monitoring tools (like MongoDB's profiling tools or application-level metrics) showing an unusually high number of queries and slow query execution times. You might see slow response times in your application, high CPU utilization on your MongoDB server, or warnings in your MongoDB logs about slow queries.\n\n\n## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step\n\nLet's assume we have a collection named `products` with documents containing `category` and `price` fields, and we frequently query for products within a specific price range and category.  Without an appropriate index, these queries will be slow.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Slow Queries**\n\nUse the MongoDB profiler to identify slow queries.  Enable profiling in your MongoDB shell:\n\n```javascript\ndb.setProfilingLevel(2) //Enables profiling level 2 (all queries)\n```\n\nRun some queries against your `products` collection. Then, retrieve the profiling data:\n\n```javascript\ndb.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:10}}) //Finds queries that took longer than 10ms\n```\n\nThis will show you the queries, their execution time, and whether they used an index.\n\n\n**Step 2: Create the Index**\n\nBased on the slow query analysis, we'll create a compound index on `category` and `price` fields. This allows MongoDB to efficiently locate documents matching specific category and price range criteria:\n\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )\n```\n\nThis creates an ascending index on `category` and then `price`.  The order matters for compound indexes; MongoDB uses the first field for initial filtering and then the subsequent fields to refine the results.  If your queries frequently filter by price first, adjust the order accordingly (`{ price: 1, category: 1 }`).\n\n\n**Step 3: Verify Index Usage**\n\nAfter creating the index, run the slow queries again and check the profiler output.  You should now see that the queries utilize the index, resulting in significantly faster execution times.\n\n\n**Step 4:  Monitor Performance**\n\nContinuously monitor your application's performance and MongoDB's query execution times. You might need to adjust indexes over time as query patterns change.  Regularly review the profiling data to ensure your indexes remain effective.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nIndexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They create a sorted structure based on specified fields, allowing MongoDB to quickly locate documents matching specific criteria without having to scan the entire collection.  Creating indexes involves a trade-off: indexes require extra storage space and updates to the index occur on document insertion, update, and deletion (this can impact write performance slightly), but they dramatically improve read performance for queries that utilize them.\n\nChoosing the right index is crucial. A poorly chosen index can be useless or even hinder performance. Analyze your application's query patterns to determine the optimal fields and order for your indexes.  Compound indexes, as used in the example, are particularly useful when querying on multiple fields.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MongoDB Documentation on Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)\n* [MongoDB Query Optimization](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/optimize-queries-for-mongodb/)\n* [MongoDB Profiling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.setProfilingLevel/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
