## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is the overuse of indexes, leading to performance degradation rather than improvement. While indexes are crucial for optimizing query performance, creating too many, especially on fields not frequently used in queries, can negatively impact write operations and increase storage overhead.  This is because every write operation needs to update all affected indexes.  The write lock contention caused by numerous index updates can significantly slow down your application.  Moreover, excessive indexing consumes more disk space.


## Code Example & Fixing Steps (Illustrative)

This example demonstrates a scenario where unnecessary indexes lead to performance issues.  We'll focus on fixing the problem rather than directly showing the problematic code (as the problematic code would be numerous indexes on infrequently queried fields).

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields like `name`, `description`, `price`, `category`, `manufacturer`, `reviews`, and a few others. We suspect that we've created many indexes that are not needed.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array of all indexes. Carefully review each index and assess its usage. Look for indexes on fields rarely used in `find()` operations. For instance, an index on the `reviews` field might be unnecessary if queries rarely filter based on reviews.


**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified unnecessary indexes, drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to remove.  You can find the index name in the output of `db.collection.getIndexes()`.

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For example, if you have an index named `manufacturer_1`, you would use:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("manufacturer_1")
```


**Step 3:  Monitor Performance:**

After dropping unnecessary indexes, monitor the performance of your application's write operations and overall database performance.  Use MongoDB monitoring tools or profiling to measure write times and identify any remaining bottlenecks.


**Step 4:  Strategic Indexing:**

Create indexes strategically based on your most frequent queries.  Focus on compound indexes that cover the most common query patterns. For example, if you often query products by `category` and `price`, create a compound index on `{"category": 1, "price": 1}`.


## Explanation

Over-indexing creates several problems:

* **Write Performance Bottleneck:** Every write operation needs to update all indexes, slowing down insertions, updates, and deletions.
* **Increased Storage Usage:** Indexes consume disk space, and excessive indexes lead to larger database sizes.
* **Query Performance (Counterintuitively):** While indexes improve query performance in most cases, too many indexes can increase the overhead of query planning and selection, sometimes slowing down queries.
* **Increased Complexity:** Managing numerous indexes increases the complexity of database administration.

The solution involves careful analysis of your query patterns and creation of only the necessary indexes to optimize the specific queries used most often.
