This challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card that gives the illusion of depth using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this effect through clever use of shadows, transformations, and layering.  No complex JavaScript is required.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be a rectangular shape with a subtle, realistic 3D effect.  Key styling elements include:

*   A light background color.
*   A soft, inner shadow to create a recessed look.
*   A darker, outer shadow to give the impression of depth.
*   A slight elevation using `translateZ`.
*   Rounded corners for a softer feel.

**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="w-64 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl shadow-gray-400/50 transform transition duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-2xl  ">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Card Image" class="rounded-t-lg w-full">
  <div class="p-4">
    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">

**Explanation:**

*   `w-64`: Sets the width of the card to 64 units (Tailwind's utility classes).
*   `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.
*   `rounded-lg`: Applies large rounded corners.
*   `shadow-xl shadow-gray-400/50`: Creates a large shadow with a 50% opacity gray color. This is the main shadow giving depth.
*   `transform transition duration-300`: Enables smooth transitions for hover effects.
*   `hover:scale-105`: Slightly increases the scale on hover, enhancing the 3D feel.
*   `hover:shadow-2xl`:  Increases shadow size on hover for emphasis.
*   `rounded-t-lg`: Applies large rounded corners to the top of the image within the card.
*   The inner `<div>` with `p-4` adds padding to the content area.
*   Tailwind's pre-defined classes are used for typography (`text-lg`, `font-bold`, etc.) and button styling.
