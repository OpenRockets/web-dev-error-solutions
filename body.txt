**Description of the Error:**

A common problem in MongoDB development is creating too many indexes. While indexes significantly improve query performance, having excessive indexes can lead to several detrimental effects:

* **Write Performance Degradation:** Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all indexes.  Too many indexes dramatically increase the overhead of write operations, slowing down application performance.
* **Storage Consumption:** Indexes consume disk space.  An excessive number can significantly increase storage costs and impact overall database size.
* **Increased Maintenance:** Managing and monitoring many indexes becomes complex and time-consuming.

This problem manifests as slow write performance and increased storage usage without a corresponding improvement in read performance.  You might not immediately see errors, but your application's overall responsiveness will suffer.


**Fixing Step-by-Step:**

This solution focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.

1. **Identify Unused Indexes:**

   Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on a collection.  Then, analyze your application's query patterns.  Identify indexes that are not used or are rarely used compared to their cost.

   ```javascript
   use myDatabase; // Replace myDatabase with your database name
   db.myCollection.getIndexes() //Replace myCollection with your collection name
   ```

   This will return a list of index specifications. Pay close attention to the `key` field, which shows the indexed fields.  Analyze your application logs and query profiling to determine which indexes are actually being utilized.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

   Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method to remove indexes that are identified as unnecessary.  Remember to always back up your data before making changes to indexes.

   ```javascript
   use myDatabase;
   db.myCollection.dropIndex( { "field1": 1, "field2": -1 } ); // Replace with your index specification
   ```
   This command removes a compound index on `field1` (ascending) and `field2` (descending).  Replace the index specification with the specific index you want to remove.  You can also drop indexes by name:

   ```javascript
   db.myCollection.dropIndex("myIndexName"); // Replace with your index name
   ```


3. **Optimize Existing Indexes:**

   Instead of creating many simple indexes, consider creating compound indexes that cover multiple fields frequently used together in queries. This can reduce the number of indexes while still maintaining good query performance.  For example, if you often query on `field1` and `field2` together, a single compound index on `{"field1": 1, "field2": 1}` is often more efficient than separate indexes on `field1` and `field2`.

4. **Monitor Performance:**

   After removing or modifying indexes, monitor your database's write and read performance.  Use MongoDB's monitoring tools or profiling to ensure that your changes have improved performance and haven't introduced any new bottlenecks.

**Explanation:**

The key to managing indexes is balancing the benefits of improved query performance with the potential drawbacks of write performance degradation and increased storage usage. By systematically analyzing index usage, removing unnecessary indexes, and optimizing existing ones, you can achieve a more efficient and balanced database configuration.  Remember that the optimal number of indexes varies depending on your application's workload and data characteristics.
