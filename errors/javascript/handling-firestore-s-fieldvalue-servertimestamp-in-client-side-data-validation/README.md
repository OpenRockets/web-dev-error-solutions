# 🐞 Handling Firestore's `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` in Client-Side Data Validation


## Description of the Error

A common issue when working with Firestore and timestamps is attempting to directly set a `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` value on the client-side before sending data to the server.  Firestore's `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` is specifically designed to be set *only* on the server.  Trying to set it client-side results in the error:

```
Error:  Failed to set value for field 'timestamp': ServerTimestamp is not supported by the client.
```

This error prevents the document from being written to Firestore.  This often occurs when attempting to use a timestamp as a creation date or update date for posts.  The client might try to pre-populate the timestamp field with the `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` object, thinking it will be correctly handled. However, this approach breaks because the client lacks the necessary server-side capabilities to generate the accurate timestamp.


## Fixing the Error Step-by-Step

The solution is to avoid setting the timestamp on the client. Instead, let Firestore handle the timestamp generation.  Here's how you can achieve this using JavaScript (the same principle applies to other languages):


**Step 1: Data Structure (example)**

```javascript
const postData = {
  title: "My Awesome Post",
  content: "This is the content of my awesome post.",
  author: "John Doe",
  // NO timestamp here! We will let Firestore handle this.
};
```

**Step 2: Setting the Document with Firestore**

```javascript
import { getFirestore, collection, addDoc, serverTimestamp } from "firebase/firestore";

const db = getFirestore();
const postsCollectionRef = collection(db, "posts");

addDoc(postsCollectionRef, {
  ...postData,
  timestamp: serverTimestamp(), // Set the timestamp on the server-side only.
})
.then((docRef) => {
  console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error adding document: ", error);
});

```

**Step 3: (Optional) Retrieving and Displaying Timestamps**

When retrieving the data, Firestore will return a proper `Timestamp` object. You can convert this to a more user-friendly format (like a date string) using the following:

```javascript
//Assuming you retrieved a document with a timestamp field:
const doc = {timestamp: new Date()}

const timestamp = doc.timestamp;

//Convert Firestore Timestamp to a Date object
const date = timestamp.toDate();

//Format the Date object as a string
const formattedDate = date.toLocaleString(); // or any other date formatting method

console.log(formattedDate)
```

## Explanation

The crucial change is removing the timestamp from the `postData` object and instead setting it directly within the `addDoc` function using `serverTimestamp()`. This ensures that the timestamp is generated by the Firestore server, guaranteeing accuracy and preventing the client-side error. This approach leverages Firestore's built-in functionality for creating accurate timestamps that are synchronized with the server's clock, ensuring consistency across all clients.
