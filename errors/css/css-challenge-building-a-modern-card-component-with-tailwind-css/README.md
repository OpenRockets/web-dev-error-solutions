# üêû CSS Challenge:  Building a Modern Card Component with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive product card using Tailwind CSS. The goal is to build a card that showcases product information clearly and attractively, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for rapid development and maintainable styling.

## Description of the Styling:

The card will feature:

* **A product image:** Occupying the top portion of the card.
* **Product title:** A concise and prominent heading.
* **Product description:** A short paragraph summarizing the product.
* **Price:** Clearly displayed with appropriate styling.
* **Add to cart button:** A call-to-action button for users.
* **Responsive design:**  The layout should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* **Modern aesthetics:**  Using a clean, contemporary design language.


## Full Code:

```html
<div class="max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700">
  <a href="#">
    <img class="p-4 rounded-t-lg" src="https://flowbite.com/docs/images/blog/image-1.jpg" alt="product image" />

    </a>
    <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">Here are the biggest enterprise technology acquisitions of 2023 so far, and what they mean for the industry.</p>
    <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        This is an example of a product description, which can be used to provide more information about the product. You can add as much information as you want.
    </p>
    <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
      <span class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">$49</span>
      <a href="#" class="text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800">Add to cart</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

```

## Explanation:

This code uses Tailwind CSS classes to style the card. Let's break down some key aspects:

* `max-w-sm`: Sets a maximum width for the card.
* `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.
* `rounded-lg`: Adds rounded corners.
* `shadow-md`: Applies a subtle shadow.
*  `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, etc.:  These control text size, weight, and color.  Tailwind offers a vast array of such classes.
* `flex items-center justify-between`: This creates a flexbox container to arrange the price and button horizontally.
* Dark mode support: classes like `dark:bg-gray-800` and `dark:text-white` ensure the card adapts to dark mode.
