[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating an interactive card that expands on hover, revealing additional content. We'll be using Tailwind CSS for its rapid prototyping capabilities and ease of styling.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling:\n\nThe card will initially be compact, displaying a title and a brief summary. On hover, the card will smoothly expand vertically, revealing a more detailed description.  The animation will be subtle and visually appealing, using Tailwind's transition utilities.  We will also incorporate some basic styling for visual appeal, including rounded corners and shadows.\n\n\n## Full Code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:shadow-2xl hover:scale-105\">\n    <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n      <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Card Title</div>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n        This is a short summary of the card content.  It will expand on hover.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"px-6 pt-4 pb-2 hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:block\" style=\"max-height:0;overflow:hidden\">\n      <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n        This is the expanded content of the card.  You can add more details here as needed.  This text will smoothly appear on hover.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation:\n\n* **`transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`**: This Tailwind class applies a smooth transition to all properties that change, with a duration of 300ms and an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`hover:shadow-2xl hover:scale-105`**:  On hover, the shadow becomes more prominent (`shadow-2xl`), and the card scales slightly (`scale-105`).\n* **`hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:block`**: The expanded content is initially hidden (`hidden`). On hover, it becomes visible (`block`), and the transition is applied.  `style=\"max-height:0;overflow:hidden;\"` is added to initially collapse the height.\n* **Tailwind classes**:  We use Tailwind classes extensively for styling, such as `bg-gray-100`, `max-w-sm`, `rounded`, `overflow-hidden`, `shadow-lg`, `px-6`, `py-4`, `font-bold`, `text-xl`, `text-gray-700`, and `text-base`.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More:\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)\n* **CSS Transitions and Animations:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
