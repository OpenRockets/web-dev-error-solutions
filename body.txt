## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB, especially in larger and more complex applications, is having "too many indexes."  While indexes speed up queries, excessive indexing can lead to significant performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes). This is because every write operation needs to update all relevant indexes, adding overhead.  The symptoms might include slow write performance, high write latency, and increased storage consumption. MongoDB might even explicitly log warnings about excessive index usage.


## Step-by-Step Code for Fixing the Problem

This solution focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  We'll assume you have access to the MongoDB shell or a suitable driver.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

First, list all indexes on a specific collection. Replace `<database_name>` and `<collection_name>` with your actual names.

```javascript
use <database_name>;
db.<collection_name>.getIndexes();
```

This will return a JSON array of all indexes in the specified collection, showing their keys, and other metadata.  Examine the output carefully.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage:**

The `db.collection.stats()` command provides information about collection size, index size, and index usage. This isn't directly a "usage count" but can point to underutilized indexes.

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.stats();
```

Look at the `indexSizes` field. Large indexes with minimal impact on query performance are candidates for removal.

**Step 3: Determine Unnecessary Indexes:**

Carefully review the indexes identified in Step 1. Ask yourself:

* **Is this index used frequently?**  Analyze your application's query patterns. If a query doesn't use an index (and you can confirm through MongoDB Profiler), it's a candidate for removal.
* **Does this index overlap significantly with another index?** Redundant indexes are a big performance culprit. Often, one index can cover queries that several smaller, more specific indexes could handle.
* **Is this index for a field rarely used in queries?**  Indexes on infrequently accessed fields are mostly wasted space and write overhead.

**Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've pinpointed unnecessary indexes, use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove them. Replace `<index_name>` with the name of the index you want to drop (you'll find this in the output of `getIndexes()`).

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.dropIndex("<index_name>");
```

To drop multiple indexes in one go, you may use this:

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.dropIndexes(); //Drops ALL indexes, USE WITH CAUTION
```


**Step 5: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Measure write times and storage usage to ensure the changes have a positive impact.  The MongoDB Profiler (see references below) can help identify slow queries and which indexes are effectively used.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes negatively impacts write performance because each write requires updating all affected indexes. This overhead increases exponentially with the number of indexes.  The goal is to strike a balance between fast query performance and acceptable write performance.  Proper index selection and removal are key to optimizing the MongoDB database.
