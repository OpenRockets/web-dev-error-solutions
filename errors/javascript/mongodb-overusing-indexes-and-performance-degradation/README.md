# üêû MongoDB: Overusing Indexes and Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is overusing indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, creating too many or inappropriately designed indexes can lead to performance degradation.  This happens because write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) become slower as MongoDB needs to update all affected indexes.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space, impacting storage costs and potentially overall database performance. This is particularly noticeable on high-write environments.  Symptoms include sluggish write operations, increased latency, and slower query performance in some cases (despite the presence of indexes).


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products`. We'll assume you're using the MongoDB shell.  Replace `your_database` and `products` with your actual database and collection names.


**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

```javascript
use your_database;
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This command lists all indexes on the `products` collection.  Pay close attention to the fields included in each index.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage:**

The most effective approach is to use MongoDB Profiler to identify which indexes are actually used and which are not.  Enable profiling:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enables slow queries profiling
```

Perform typical queries against your `products` collection. After some time, disable profiling and retrieve the profiling data:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(0);
db.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:10}}).sort({millis:-1})
```

This shows slow queries (queries taking more than 10 milliseconds). Examine the `ns` (namespace) and `query` fields to see which indexes were used (or not used, but should have been).


**Step 3: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on the profiler results and your understanding of typical queries, identify indexes that are rarely or never used. For example, indexes on fields that are never used in `$eq`, `$in`, or `$sort` clauses are candidates for removal.


**Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified the unnecessary indexes, remove them using the following command, replacing `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index (from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`).

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>");
```

For example, to drop an index named `price_1_index`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("price_1_index");
```

You can also drop multiple indexes at once:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndexes(["price_1_index", "name_index"]);
```


**Step 5: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Pay attention to both write and read operations. You might need to iterate on index selection and removal.


## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to write performance degradation because every write operation requires updating all affected indexes.  The increased I/O overhead from managing many indexes can outweigh the benefits of faster reads, especially if those indexes are rarely used.  Analyzing index usage with the profiler allows for data-driven decisions, ensuring that indexes are only created where truly beneficial. Removing unused indexes frees up disk space, reduces I/O, and improves overall database performance.
