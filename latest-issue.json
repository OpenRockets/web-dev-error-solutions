[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D hover effect using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature a background image, title, and description, and on hover, it will subtly lift and slightly enlarge, simulating a 3D effect.  This is achieved using Tailwind's utility classes for transitions, transforms, and shadows.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will have a clean, modern design.  The base style will present a card with a rounded border, a subtle shadow, and its content neatly arranged. On hover, a transition will smoothly animate the card scaling up slightly (1.02x) and shifting slightly upward and forward, creating a sense of depth. The shadow will also intensify on hover to reinforce the 3D effect.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg transition duration-300 transform hover:scale-102 hover:shadow-2xl hover:-translate-y-1 hover:translate-z-1\">\n  <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://tailwindui.com/img/cards/card-image-1.png\" alt=\"Sunset in the mountains\">\n  <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n    <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Card Title</div>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"px-6 pt-4 pb-2\">\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2\">#photography</span>\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2\">#travel</span>\n    <span class=\"inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700\">#mountains</span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* **`rounded`:** Applies rounded corners.\n* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card boundaries.\n* **`shadow-lg`:**  Applies a large shadow.\n* **`transition duration-300`:** Enables CSS transitions with a 300ms duration.\n* **`transform`:** Enables CSS transforms (scale and translate).\n* **`hover:scale-102`:** Scales the card to 102% on hover.\n* **`hover:shadow-2xl`:** Increases the shadow size on hover.\n* **`hover:-translate-y-1`:** Moves the card 1 pixel upward on hover.\n* **`hover:translate-z-1`:** Moves the card 1 pixel forward on the z-axis (creating the 3D illusion).\n*  The rest of the code uses Tailwind classes for styling the image and text content within the card.  Replace `\"https://tailwindui.com/img/cards/card-image-1.png\"` with the URL of your desired image.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  -  The official Tailwind CSS documentation is an excellent resource for learning about all its utility classes and functionalities.\n* **CSS Transitions and Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - These MDN web docs provide in-depth explanations of CSS transitions and transforms.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
