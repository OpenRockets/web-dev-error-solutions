## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating sorted data structures, adding too many indexes can drastically reduce write performance and increase storage consumption.  This occurs because every write operation requires updating all affected indexes, and excessive indexes lead to significant write overhead.  The performance gains from faster reads may be entirely offset by slower writes, resulting in a net performance decrease.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume considerable disk space, increasing storage costs.

## Fixing Step-by-Step Code

This example demonstrates identifying and addressing over-indexing using the MongoDB shell and analyzing query patterns.  We'll assume you have a collection named `products` with various indexes already in place.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

```javascript
use your_database_name;
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This command lists all indexes on the `products` collection.  Replace `your_database_name` with your actual database name.  Examine the output carefully to understand which fields are indexed and their types.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns**

Examine your application's logs and monitor MongoDB's performance metrics (e.g., using `db.currentOp()`). Identify the most frequent queries.  Focus on queries that are slow or critical to the application's performance.

**Example Log Entry (Illustrative):**

```
2024-10-27T10:00:00.000+0000 I QUERY    [conn1] db.products.find({ category: "electronics", price: { $lt: 100 } })
```

**Step 3: Optimize Indexes**

Based on the query patterns, selectively remove unnecessary indexes. For example, if the `products` collection often requires filtering on `category` and `price` together, retain the compound index on `{"category": 1, "price": 1}`.  However, a separate index on only `price` might be redundant if queries always include `category`.


```javascript
// Remove an unnecessary index (example - carefully review before removing)
db.products.dropIndex("price_1");
```

**Step 4: Create Compound Indexes**

For queries involving multiple fields, create compound indexes to improve performance. Compound indexes efficiently sort data based on multiple fields.

```javascript
// Create a compound index on category and price
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After modifying indexes, monitor the database's performance using profiling tools and monitoring dashboards.  Ensure that write operations are not unduly affected and that read performance has improved for critical queries.  MongoDB Compass provides helpful tools for visualization.

## Explanation

Over-indexing increases write latency because the write operation needs to update all related indexes.  Compound indexes can be more efficient than multiple single-field indexes for queries involving multiple fields; they reduce the number of index lookups needed. Identifying the most frequent query patterns is crucial; only index the fields most often used in filtering or sorting.  The goal is to balance read performance improvements with the overhead of index maintenance on writes.
