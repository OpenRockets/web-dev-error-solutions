## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes are crucial for query performance, creating too many or inappropriately designed indexes can lead to significant performance degradation, especially during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  Every index adds overhead to write operations because MongoDB must update the index every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This overhead can outweigh the benefits of faster reads if there are too many indexes or if they're not optimized for the most frequent queries.  The symptom is often slow write performance despite seemingly well-structured queries.  The database might also exhibit high CPU utilization and increased storage space usage due to the large index size.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  Let's assume you're experiencing slow write performance in a collection called "products" with indexes on `category`, `price`, `brand`, and `description`.  Analysis shows that queries on `category` and `price` are frequent, while those on `brand` and `description` are infrequent.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes using `db.collection.getIndexes()`:**

```javascript
use mydatabase; // Replace mydatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command will return a list of all indexes in the `products` collection.  Examine the usage statistics (if available) or assess query patterns to identify underutilized indexes.


**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes using `db.collection.dropIndex()`:**

Based on the output from Step 1, let's assume we want to drop indexes on `brand` and `description`.

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("brand_1") // Replace "brand_1" with the actual index name
db.products.dropIndex("description_1") // Replace "description_1" with the actual index name
```

Note: The index names (`brand_1`, `description_1`) are examples.  Use the actual names returned by `db.collection.getIndexes()`.


**Step 3: Verify Index Removal:**

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

Confirm that the indexes have been successfully removed.


**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After dropping unnecessary indexes, monitor the write performance of your application. You should observe improved insert, update, and delete speeds.  Tools like MongoDB Compass or monitoring agents can help track performance metrics.


## Explanation

Over-indexing adds overhead to write operations because every index needs to be updated for every write. This overhead can become significant, slowing down your application. The cost of maintaining many indexes increases exponentially with the size of the collection and the number of indexes.  A good indexing strategy prioritizes frequent query patterns and uses compound indexes efficiently to reduce the number of indexes needed. Dropping underutilized indexes removes this unnecessary overhead, freeing up resources and improving write performance.  Efficient indexes should be carefully chosen based on query selectivity and usage frequency analysis.
