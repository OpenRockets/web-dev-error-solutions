# üêû MongoDB: Overusing Indexes Leading to Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating ordered lookup structures, creating too many indexes, or indexing inappropriate fields, can lead to substantial performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because every write operation requires updating all affected indexes, adding significant overhead.  The slowdown can be far worse than the benefits gained from faster reads, resulting in a net performance loss.  This is especially noticeable in high-write environments.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with fields like `name`, `category`, `price`, `description`, and `tags` (an array).  We initially created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and even `tags` individually, leading to slow writes.  We'll optimize this.

**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns:**

First, carefully analyze your application's queries using MongoDB's profiling tools (see external references). Identify the most frequent and performance-critical queries. These are the ones that should be prioritized for indexing.

**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

Review the existing indexes on your `products` collection. Let's say the `description` and `tags` indexes are rarely used and contribute heavily to write overhead.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.products.dropIndex()` command to remove the indexes on `description` and `tags`:

```javascript
// Remove the index on the description field
db.products.dropIndex("description_1")

// Remove the index on the tags field (assuming a simple index)
db.products.dropIndex("tags_1")

//If you have a compound index involving tags, replace "tags_1" with the correct index name. Use db.products.getIndexes() to list your indexes.
```

**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes (Compound Indexes):**

Instead of individual indexes on `name`, `category`, and `price`, consider a compound index that combines frequently used query criteria. For instance, if queries often filter by `category` and then by `price`, a compound index would be beneficial:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This single compound index will support queries filtering by `category` alone, `price` alone, or both in that specific order.


**Step 5: Monitor Performance:**

After making changes, carefully monitor performance using MongoDB's profiling tools and metrics.  Observe write operation times and overall database performance to ensure the changes improve performance.


## Explanation

Over-indexing increases storage space, slows down write operations, and consumes more memory during index maintenance.  The key to efficient indexing is selectivity.  Indexes should be created for fields frequently used in `$eq`, `$in`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc., queries within the `find()` operation.  Indexes are less effective with queries that utilize `$regex` or operators on non-indexed fields. Compound indexes strategically combine multiple fields to support a wider range of queries efficiently, reducing the number of individual indexes required.  Careful analysis of query patterns is crucial to creating a balanced indexing strategy that maximizes read performance without crippling write performance.
