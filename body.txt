**Description of the Problem:**

Developers often encounter performance issues when storing and retrieving large amounts of post data in Firebase Firestore, especially when dealing with features like comments, likes, and user interactions.  Naive approaches, such as storing all post data in a single document or fetching entire collections for every user interaction, lead to slow loading times, increased latency, and potentially exceeding Firestore's document size limits (1MB).  This problem manifests as slow application response, poor user experience, and high costs due to excessive read/write operations.

**Code (Step-by-Step Solution):**

This solution demonstrates using a combination of techniques to improve efficiency:

1. **Data Denormalization:**  Instead of embedding all comments within a post document, store them in a separate collection (`comments`).  This allows for independent querying and updating of comments without affecting the main post document.  Similarly, store likes and other interactions in separate collections.

2. **Pagination:**  Avoid retrieving all posts at once. Instead, fetch posts in batches using pagination.  This reduces the initial load time and prevents overwhelming the client application with large amounts of data.

3. **Indexes:** Create appropriate composite indexes to optimize queries. This is crucial for efficient filtering and sorting of posts.

4. **Client-Side Filtering:** Filter data on the client side as much as possible to reduce the amount of data transferred from the server.


**Code Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
// 1. Create a post:
async function createPost(post) {
  const postRef = firestore.collection('posts').doc();
  await postRef.set({
    ...post,
    postId: postRef.id,
  });
}


// 2. Add a comment:
async function addComment(postId, comment) {
  const commentRef = firestore.collection('posts').doc(postId).collection('comments').doc();
  await commentRef.set({
    ...comment,
    commentId: commentRef.id,
  });
}

// 3. Fetch posts with pagination (example - 10 posts per page):
async function fetchPosts(page = 1, pageSize = 10) {
  const startIndex = (page - 1) * pageSize;
  const query = firestore.collection('posts').orderBy('createdAt', 'desc').limit(pageSize).offset(startIndex);
  const querySnapshot = await query.get();
  return querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));
}

// 4. Example of a query with an index (assuming an index on 'userId' and 'createdAt'):
async function fetchUserPosts(userId) {
    const query = firestore.collection('posts').where('userId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc').limit(20);
    const querySnapshot = await query.get();
    // ...process results
}

// Remember to create appropriate Firestore indexes in your console.  
// For the above example, you would need a composite index on 'userId' and 'createdAt' for the fetchUserPosts function to be efficient.

```


**Explanation:**

This approach significantly improves performance by:

* **Reducing Data Transfer:** Only necessary data is retrieved.
* **Improving Query Performance:**  Proper indexing and efficient queries reduce latency.
* **Scaling Better:** The solution handles increasing data volumes more gracefully.
