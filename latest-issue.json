[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a visually appealing card with a subtle shimmer effect using only CSS.  We'll be leveraging CSS gradients and animations to achieve this. No JavaScript required!\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe goal is to create a card with a light, almost ethereal, shimmer. The card itself will have rounded corners and a subtle shadow. The shimmer will be a subtle animation of a gradient that moves across the card, giving the illusion of light reflecting off its surface.  We'll use a dark background color to make the shimmer stand out.\n\n**Full Code (CSS Only):**\n\n```css\n.shimmer-card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  background: #333; /* Dark background */\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning of the shimmer */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide shimmer overflow */\n}\n\n.shimmer-card::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,255,255,0.2), rgba(255,255,255,0.8), rgba(255,255,255,0.2));\n  animation: shimmer 1.5s linear infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes shimmer {\n  0% {\n    transform: translateX(-100%);\n  }\n  100% {\n    transform: translateX(100%);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**HTML (Example):**\n\nYou would simply include a `<div>` with the class `shimmer-card` in your HTML to use this CSS:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"shimmer-card\"></div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.shimmer-card`**: This class styles the main card element.  It sets the dimensions, background color, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow.  `position: relative` is crucial for positioning the pseudo-element absolutely within the card. `overflow: hidden` prevents the shimmer from overflowing the card boundaries.\n\n* **`.shimmer-card::before`**: This is a pseudo-element (a way to style an element without adding extra HTML) that creates the shimmer effect.  It uses a linear gradient with varying opacity of white to create the light reflection. The `animation` property applies the `shimmer` animation.\n\n* **`@keyframes shimmer`**: This defines the animation. The `transform: translateX()` moves the gradient horizontally across the card, creating the shimmering effect.  `linear` ensures a constant speed, and `infinite` makes it loop continuously.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Gradients:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Animations:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Tutorials):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
