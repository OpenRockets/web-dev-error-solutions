**Description of the Error:**

One common problem developers encounter in MongoDB is having too many indexes.  While indexes speed up queries, an excessive number can significantly degrade write performance.  Every write operation must update all affected indexes, and a large number of indexes leads to longer write times, increased storage consumption, and overall database sluggishness.  This manifests as slow application performance, particularly noticeable during periods of high write activity.  The MongoDB server logs might not always explicitly state "too many indexes," but the symptoms (slow writes, increased latency) are clear indicators.

**Explanation:**

Indexes are crucial for query optimization, but they're a trade-off. Each index adds overhead to write operations.  The optimal number of indexes is database-specific and depends on query patterns.  Having many indexes that are rarely used is detrimental.  The key is to identify and remove unused or redundant indexes.  Analyzing query logs helps identify which indexes are most frequently utilized.


**Fixing Step-by-Step (using MongoDB Compass and the `mongo` shell):**

We'll demonstrate using a sample collection called `products` with indexes on `productName`, `category`, and a compound index on `category` and `price`. Let's assume analysis reveals the index on `productName` is rarely used.

**1. Identify Unused Indexes (using MongoDB Compass):**

* Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.
* Select the `products` collection.
* Navigate to the "Indexes" tab.  Compass visually displays all indexes with statistics (if available) to help determine usage.  Unused indexes will generally show low usage counts.


**2. Identify Unused Indexes (using the `mongo` shell):**

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a list of all indexes on the `products` collection. Examine the usage statistics (if available) or rely on your query analysis to identify unused indexes.  In our example, let's say the `productName` index is unused.


**3. Drop the Unused Index (using the `mongo` shell):**

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("productName_1"); // Replace "productName_1" with the actual index name from getIndexes() output.  The "_1" suffix might vary.
```

**4. Verify the Index Removal (using the `mongo` shell):**

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

Confirm that the `productName` index is no longer present in the output.


**5. Monitor Performance:**

After dropping the unnecessary index, closely monitor write performance. You should observe improvements in write times and overall database responsiveness. Use MongoDB's monitoring tools or application performance monitoring solutions to track these metrics.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Thorough Analysis:** Before dropping any index, ensure it's truly unused.  Inaccurate assessment can negatively impact query performance.
* **Query Profiling:**  Use MongoDB's profiling tools to analyze query performance and identify slow queries.  This helps determine which indexes are truly needed.
* **Incremental Approach:** Drop indexes one at a time and monitor the impact to avoid unintended consequences.
* **Regular Review:**  Periodically review your indexes to identify and remove unused or redundant ones.
