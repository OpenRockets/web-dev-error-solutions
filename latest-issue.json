[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing circular progress bar using Tailwind CSS.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes to simplify the styling process and achieve a clean, modern look.  The progress bar will be dynamic, allowing you to easily adjust the percentage displayed.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe progress bar consists of a circular base and a filled arc representing the progress percentage.  We'll use Tailwind's `relative`, `bg-gray-300`, `rounded-full`, and other utility classes to style the base circle.  The filled arc will be created using an absolutely positioned pseudo-element (`::before`) with a background color, rotated using `transform: rotate()`, and styled to be a semi-circle using `clip-path`.  The percentage will be displayed in the center of the circle.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Circular Progress Bar</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center items-center h-screen\">\n  <div class=\"relative w-48 h-48\">\n    <div class=\"absolute w-full h-full rounded-full bg-gray-300\"></div>\n    <div class=\"absolute w-full h-full rounded-full bg-blue-500\" \n         style=\"clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 100%); transform: rotate(225deg);\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"absolute text-center w-full text-white\">\n      <span class=\"text-2xl font-bold\">75%</span>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Outer `div`:** Sets up the container for the progress bar, centering it on the page using Tailwind's flexbox utilities.\n* **Inner `divs`:**\n    * The first inner `div` creates the base circle using `rounded-full` and a gray background.\n    * The second inner `div` (pseudo-element) creates the filled arc.  `clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 100%);` cuts the circle in half, creating a semi-circle.  `transform: rotate(225deg);` rotates this semi-circle to represent the progress (75% in this case, which is 270 degrees * 75/100 = 202.5 degrees.  We use 225 to adjust for starting position).   Adjust the `rotate` value to change the percentage.\n    * The third `div` displays the percentage value in the center.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) -  Comprehensive documentation on Tailwind CSS.\n* **CSS `clip-path` Property:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) - Learn more about the `clip-path` property for creating custom shapes.\n* **Flexbox in CSS:** [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) -  Understanding flexbox for layout.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
