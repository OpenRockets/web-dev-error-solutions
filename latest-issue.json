[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB: having too many indexes. While indexes speed up queries, an excessive number can significantly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) and increase storage space.  This happens because MongoDB must update all relevant indexes every time a document is modified.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance degradation. You might observe slow write performance, increased storage usage, and potentially high CPU usage, especially during periods of high write activity.  Analyzing MongoDB logs might reveal slow index updates as a bottleneck. The root cause is usually having far more indexes than necessary, especially overlapping or redundant ones.\n\n**Example Scenario:**  Imagine you have a collection of products with fields like `category`, `price`, `brand`, and `description`.  Creating separate indexes for `category`, `price`, `brand`, and combinations like `{\"category\": 1, \"price\": 1}` is fine if frequently queried. However, adding indexes for every possible combination will negatively impact write performance.\n\n**Fixing Step-by-Step:**\n\nLet's assume we have a `products` collection and have identified excessive indexing as the problem.  Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. **Identify Redundant Indexes:** Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes. Analyze them for redundancy.  For example, if you have indexes on `{\"category\": 1}` and `{\"category\": 1, \"price\": 1}`, the second index largely duplicates the first's benefit for queries filtering only on `category`.\n\n   ```javascript\n   use your_database_name;\n   db.products.getIndexes();\n   ```\n\n2. **Analyze Query Patterns:** Use MongoDB's profiling capabilities or your application's logging to understand which queries are most frequent and what indexes they are (or are not) utilizing. This helps determine which indexes are truly essential.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Enable profiling (level 2 is recommended for detailed information)\n   db.setProfilingLevel(2);\n\n   // ... run your application ...\n\n   // Examine the profiling data\n   db.system.profile.find({millis: {$gt: 10}}) //Find slow operations (adjust millis as needed).\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove Unnecessary Indexes:** Once you've identified redundant or underutilized indexes, remove them using `db.collection.dropIndex()`.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index (from `db.collection.getIndexes()` output).\n\n   ```javascript\n   db.products.dropIndex(\"category_1_price_1\"); // Example: Drop the composite index\n   ```\n\n4. **Optimize Existing Indexes:**  For frequently queried fields, ensure you're using the most efficient index type (e.g., compound indexes for multi-field queries).\n\n5. **Monitor Performance:** After removing or modifying indexes, monitor write performance using MongoDB's monitoring tools or application performance monitoring (APM) systems.  You should see an improvement in write speeds.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBy removing unnecessary indexes, you reduce the overhead of index maintenance.  MongoDB only needs to update a smaller number of indexes for each write operation, thus improving write performance and reducing storage space.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [MongoDB Documentation on Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)\n* [MongoDB Performance Tuning](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/performance/)\n* [Understanding Index Usage in MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/understanding-index-usage-in-mongodb)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
