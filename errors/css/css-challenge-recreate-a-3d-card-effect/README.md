# üêû CSS Challenge: Recreate a 3D Card Effect


This challenge focuses on recreating a visually appealing 3D card effect using only CSS. We'll achieve this through box-shadow manipulation, transforms, and transitions to create a realistic depth and hover effect.  This solution utilizes plain CSS3, but could be adapted to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS with minimal changes.

**Description of the Styling:**

The goal is to style a div element to resemble a physical card subtly lifted from the surface.  The key elements are:

* **Base Card:** A rectangular card with a subtle light grey background.
* **Shadow:** A carefully crafted box-shadow to simulate the card being raised. This involves multiple shadow layers for depth.
* **Hover Effect:** On hover, the card will subtly lift higher, with the shadow adjusting accordingly, to enhance the 3D illusion.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>3D Card Effect</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), -5px -5px 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4); /* Base Shadow */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */
  overflow: hidden; /* To keep content within card bounds */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px); /* Lift on hover */
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -10px -10px 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); /* Enhanced Shadow on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center; /* Example content */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    This is a 3D card!
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`box-shadow`:**  This property creates the illusion of depth. The code uses two shadows, one darker and one lighter, to simulate light and shadow on the card's surface.  The values adjust the horizontal and vertical offset, blur radius, and color of the shadows.
* **`transform: translateY()`:** This moves the card vertically on hover, creating the lifting effect.
* **`transition`:**  This ensures smooth animation of the `transform` and `box-shadow` properties when hovering over the card.
