[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card that simulates a 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS. We'll achieve this by manipulating shadows, box-sizing, and transforms.  No external libraries or images will be used.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a rectangular element with a subtle 3D effect achieved through strategically placed box-shadows.  The top will appear slightly raised, creating the illusion of depth.  We'll also add a gradient background for extra visual interest.  The text content will be neatly aligned within the card.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"w-64 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-500 rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-blue-500/50 p-6\">\n  <h2 class=\"text-white text-xl font-bold mb-2\">Featured Product</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-white text-base\">This is a sample product description.  It can be expanded to include more details.</p>\n  <button class=\"bg-white text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100 px-4 py-2 rounded mt-4\">Learn More</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `w-64`: Sets the width of the card to 64 units (Tailwind's utility classes).\n* `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-500`: Creates a background gradient transitioning from blue to purple, from top-left to bottom-right.\n* `rounded-lg`: Applies a large border radius for rounded corners.\n* `shadow-2xl shadow-blue-500/50`:  Applies a large box-shadow with a blue tint (the `/50` makes it semi-transparent).  This creates the 3D effect.\n* `p-6`: Adds 6 units of padding on all sides.\n* `text-white`: Sets the text color to white for contrast against the background.\n* `text-xl font-bold`: Styles the heading with extra-large size and bold weight.\n* `mb-2`: Adds a margin at the bottom of the heading.\n* `bg-white text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100`: Styles the button with a white background, blue text, and a hover effect that changes the background to a lighter blue.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Official Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) -  This is the primary source for learning Tailwind CSS.\n* **CSS Box-Shadow Property:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Understanding box-shadow is crucial for creating effects like this one.\n* **CSS Gradients:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient) - Learn more about creating different gradient styles.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
