# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common problem developers face in MongoDB: having too many indexes, leading to performance degradation rather than improvement.

**Description of the Error:**

MongoDB indexes significantly speed up queries by creating a sorted data structure for specific fields. However, excessive indexing can hurt performance.  Each index consumes disk space and adds overhead during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  Too many indexes increase write times and can lead to slower overall database performance, especially if many indexes are rarely used.  The symptoms might include slow write operations, increased storage usage, and even performance degradation in queries *despite* the indexes.  MongoDB itself won't throw a specific "too many indexes" error, but performance monitoring will show the problem.

**Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Examples):**

This solution focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  The exact commands depend on your preferred MongoDB client (e.g., `mongo` shell, MongoDB Compass, a driver like pymongo).

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on a collection. Analyze query logs (if available) or application usage patterns to determine which indexes are actually used frequently.  There are monitoring tools available (like MongoDB Cloud Manager) that provide detailed index usage statistics.  For this example, let's assume we're using the `mongo` shell:

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.myCollection.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array of all indexes on `myCollection`.  Examine the `key` field to see which fields are indexed and consider how often queries use those fields.  Low usage indicates potential candidates for removal.

**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you identify underutilized indexes, drop them using `db.collection.dropIndex()`.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index to be dropped (found in the output of `getIndexes()`).  If you know the index key, you can specify that instead of the name.


```javascript
// Drop index by name:
db.myCollection.dropIndex("myIndexName")

// Drop index by key:
db.myCollection.dropIndex( { "fieldName": 1 } )  // 1 for ascending, -1 for descending
```

**Step 3:  Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor write and read performance to see if the changes have improved database efficiency. Use profiling tools or performance monitoring dashboards to track key metrics like query execution time, write latency, and storage usage.


**Explanation:**

The core issue is a balance between query speed and write speed.  Indexes accelerate queries but slow down write operations.  Having too many indexes tilts this balance too far towards slower writes, diminishing overall performance.  Identifying and removing indexes that aren't frequently used restores this balance.
