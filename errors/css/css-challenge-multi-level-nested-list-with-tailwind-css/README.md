# üêû CSS Challenge:  Multi-level Nested List with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on styling a multi-level nested list using Tailwind CSS.  The goal is to create a visually appealing and easily navigable nested list with clear hierarchical distinctions between levels.  We'll use Tailwind's utility classes to achieve this efficiently and effectively.


**Description of the Styling:**

The nested list will have distinct styling for each level.  The top-level list items will have a larger font size and a slightly bolder weight.  Subsequent levels will have progressively smaller font sizes and different indentation levels to visually represent the hierarchy.  We'll also use different list item markers (bullets, numbers, etc.) for visual clarity.


**Full Code:**

```html
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Level 1 Item 1</li>
  <li class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Level 1 Item 2
    <ul class="list-decimal ml-6">
      <li class="text-base mb-1">Level 2 Item 1</li>
      <li class="text-base mb-1">Level 2 Item 2
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li class="text-sm">Level 3 Item 1</li>
          <li class="text-sm">Level 3 Item 2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="text-base mb-1">Level 2 Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Level 1 Item 3</li>
</ul>

```


**Explanation:**

* **`list-disc` & `list-decimal`:** These Tailwind classes control the list item markers. `list-disc` uses bullets, while `list-decimal` uses numbers.
* **`ml-6`:** This adds margin to the left, creating indentation for nested lists.  The value `6` corresponds to 1.5rem (adjust as needed).
* **`text-lg`, `text-base`, `text-sm`:** These classes set the font sizes (large, base, and small respectively).
* **`font-medium`:** This makes the top-level list items slightly bolder.
* **`mb-2` & `mb-1`:** These add bottom margins for spacing between list items.

This approach allows for easy customization by simply changing the Tailwind classes.  You can adjust margins, font sizes, colors, and list styles to match your specific design preferences.
