This challenge focuses on creating a card effect that simulates a 3D appearance using only CSS.  We'll achieve this using box-shadow, transforms, and transitions to give the card depth and a subtle hover effect.  This example uses plain CSS3, but similar effects can be achieved with Tailwind CSS by utilizing its utility classes.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be a simple rectangle with rounded corners.  The key to the 3D effect is a strategically placed box-shadow that creates the illusion of depth.  A subtle transform on hover will enhance this effect, making it appear as if the card is slightly lifted.

**Full Code (CSS):**

```css
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Creates the 3D effect */
  transition: transform 0.2s ease; /* Smooth transition on hover */
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px); /* Lifts the card slightly on hover */
  box-shadow: 7px 7px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Stronger shadow on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

.card-title {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-text {
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

**HTML (for context):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>3D Card Effect</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h2 class="card-title">My 3D Card</h2>
      <p class="card-text">This is a sample card with a 3D effect created using CSS.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`box-shadow`:** This property is crucial for the 3D effect.  The values `5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` create a shadow that's offset 5 pixels horizontally and vertically, with a blur radius of 10 pixels and a 20% opacity.  The values are increased on hover to enhance the effect.
* **`transform: translateY(-5px)`:** This moves the card slightly upwards on hover, further contributing to the 3D illusion.
* **`transition`:** This ensures a smooth animation when hovering over the card.
* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents any content inside the card from overflowing its boundaries.

**Tailwind CSS Equivalent (Conceptual):**

While not providing the exact same code, Tailwind CSS would allow you to achieve a similar effect using its utility classes. For example, you could use `bg-gray-200` for the background color, `rounded-lg` for rounded corners, and `shadow-lg` or `shadow-xl` for the box shadow.  The hover effect would be achieved with `hover:translate-y-[-5px]` and adjusting the shadow class on hover.
