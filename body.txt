This challenge involves creating a visually appealing card with a subtle shimmer effect using only CSS.  We'll be leveraging CSS gradients and animations to achieve this. No JavaScript required!

**Description of the Styling:**

The goal is to create a card with a light, almost ethereal, shimmer. The card itself will have rounded corners and a subtle shadow. The shimmer will be a subtle animation of a gradient that moves across the card, giving the illusion of light reflecting off its surface.  We'll use a dark background color to make the shimmer stand out.

**Full Code (CSS Only):**

```css
.shimmer-card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background: #333; /* Dark background */
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning of the shimmer */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide shimmer overflow */
}

.shimmer-card::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,255,255,0.2), rgba(255,255,255,0.8), rgba(255,255,255,0.2));
  animation: shimmer 1.5s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes shimmer {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(100%);
  }
}
```

**HTML (Example):**

You would simply include a `<div>` with the class `shimmer-card` in your HTML to use this CSS:

```html
<div class="shimmer-card"></div>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.shimmer-card`**: This class styles the main card element.  It sets the dimensions, background color, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow.  `position: relative` is crucial for positioning the pseudo-element absolutely within the card. `overflow: hidden` prevents the shimmer from overflowing the card boundaries.

* **`.shimmer-card::before`**: This is a pseudo-element (a way to style an element without adding extra HTML) that creates the shimmer effect.  It uses a linear gradient with varying opacity of white to create the light reflection. The `animation` property applies the `shimmer` animation.

* **`@keyframes shimmer`**: This defines the animation. The `transform: translateX()` moves the gradient horizontally across the card, creating the shimmering effect.  `linear` ensures a constant speed, and `infinite` makes it loop continuously.
