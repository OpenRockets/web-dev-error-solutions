## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB stems from creating too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes). This is because every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, and too many indexes increase this overhead dramatically.  Symptoms include slow write performance, increased storage space usage (indexes consume space), and potentially impacting application responsiveness.  MongoDB's query optimizer might also struggle to efficiently choose the best index, negating the performance benefits.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products` within a MongoDB database.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

First, we need to list all indexes currently present on the `products` collection.  This can be done using the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method within the MongoDB shell.

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This command will return a JSON array containing details of each index, including the fields included and their order.  Look for indexes that are rarely or never used.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage:**

The `db.collection.stats()` command provides some metrics, although it doesn't directly show index usage. A more robust method is to use the MongoDB Profiler to track query performance and see which indexes are actually used.  Enable the profiler:


```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enables slow queries profiling
```

Run some typical queries against your `products` collection.  Then disable the profiler and examine the profiling collection:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(0); // Disables profiling
db.system.profile.find({ millis: { $gt: 10 } }).sort({ millis: -1 }); // Show slow queries
```

This will show queries that took longer than 10ms to execute (adjust as needed). Examine the `ns` (namespace) and `query` fields to identify which indexes were used (or not used) for specific queries. This gives insight into which indexes are truly beneficial.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified indexes that are unused or underperforming, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method. For example, to drop an index named `_id_1_name_1`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({ _id: 1, name: 1 });
```

or to drop an index using its name:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("my_complex_index");
```

Remember to replace `"my_complex_index"` with the actual name of the index you want to remove (you can get the index name from `db.products.getIndexes()` output).


**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Measure write operation times and overall database performance to ensure the removal has improved things, not made them worse.  You might need to iterate â€“ removing indexes and observing the results until you find a good balance.


## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to write performance bottlenecks.  Every write necessitates updating all relevant indexes.  The more indexes, the more overhead and slower the writes become.  The key is to create only the indexes necessary for frequently executed queries. Identifying and removing underutilized indexes is crucial for optimizing write performance and reducing storage space usage.  MongoDB's query optimizer, while robust, can be hindered by an excessive number of indexes.  Profiling is a powerful tool to understand query behavior and index utilization.
