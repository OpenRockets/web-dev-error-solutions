This document addresses a common problem developers encounter in MongoDB: creating too many indexes, leading to performance degradation instead of improvement.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an excessive number can negatively impact write operations and storage space.

## Description of the Error

The error isn't a specific error message but a performance issue.  With too many indexes, MongoDB spends more time updating indexes on every write operation (insert, update, delete). This slows down write performance significantly.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume considerable disk space, increasing storage costs and potentially slowing read operations if the indexes themselves become too large to efficiently manage in memory.  You might observe slow write operations, increased write latency, and higher storage costs without any obvious error messages in your application logs.

## Step-by-Step Code for Fixing the Problem

This isn't about fixing code in the traditional sense, but rather optimizing your database schema and index strategy.  We'll focus on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on a specific collection.

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.myCollection.getIndexes();
```

This will return a JSON array of all indexes, including their names, keys, and options.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns:**

Examine your application's queries using the MongoDB profiler or your application logging.  This helps identify frequently used queries and the fields they access.  Focus on the queries which consume the most time and resources.

**Step 3: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

Compare the indexes listed in Step 1 with the frequently used queries from Step 2.  Indexes that aren't used in frequently executed queries are candidates for removal.  Also look for redundant indexes; for example, if you have an index on `{"fieldA": 1, "fieldB": 1}` and another on `{"fieldA": 1}`, the second index is likely redundant because the first one already covers queries using just `fieldA`.

**Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method to remove the identified unnecessary indexes.  Remember to replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to remove.

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.myCollection.dropIndex("<index_name>"); // e.g., db.myCollection.dropIndex("fieldA_1_fieldB_1")
```

**Step 5: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance to ensure write operations have improved.  Use the MongoDB profiler or monitoring tools to track write latency and other relevant metrics.  You might need to iterate on this process, carefully removing indexes one by one and monitoring the effect.

## Explanation

The core of this problem is a lack of strategic index planning.  Indexes should be created only for frequently accessed fields in your queries and should be carefully chosen to support the most common and performance-critical operations. Creating too many indexes adds overhead without proportional performance gain. The above steps aim to identify and remove the wasteful indexes, thus improving write performance and reducing storage consumption.
