[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using only CSS.  We'll achieve this using box-shadow, transforms, and transitions to create a realistic depth and hover effect.  This example uses plain CSS, but could easily be adapted to Tailwind CSS by replacing the inline styles with appropriate Tailwind classes.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will have a clean, minimalist design.  The 3D effect is created primarily through a carefully positioned box-shadow that simulates light and shadow on the card's surface.  On hover, the card will subtly lift and slightly rotate, enhancing the 3D illusion. The background will be a light grey, with the text content in a darker shade.\n\n\n## Full Code (CSS)\n\n```css\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Main box shadow for 3D effect */\n  transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition on hover */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  padding: 20px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-5px) rotateX(2deg); /* Lift and rotate on hover */\n  box-shadow: 7px 7px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n.card p {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n\n/* Example usage within HTML */\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h2>My Awesome Card</h2>\n  <p>This is some sample text for my awesome card.  It demonstrates a simple 3D effect using only CSS.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`box-shadow`:** This property is key to creating the 3D effect.  The values (5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) define the horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color of the shadow.  The hover effect increases these values to intensify the shadow.\n* **`transform`:** This property is used to translate (move) and rotate the card on hover, creating the lifting and tilting effect.\n* **`transition`:**  This property ensures a smooth animation when hovering over the card, making the effect more visually appealing.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`** Prevents content inside the card from overflowing the card boundaries, maintaining a clean look.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Box Shadow:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** (Search for \"CSS 3D effects\" for many tutorials) [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
