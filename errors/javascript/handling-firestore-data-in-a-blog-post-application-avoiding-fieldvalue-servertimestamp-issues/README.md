# 🐞 Handling Firestore Data in a Blog Post Application: Avoiding `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` Issues


This document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using Firebase Firestore to store timestamps in blog post applications: inconsistent or inaccurate timestamps when using `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`.  This often manifests as timestamps that are slightly off, or even older than expected, leading to display issues and data inconsistencies.

**Description of the Error:**

The `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` method in Firestore is designed to provide a server-generated timestamp, ensuring accuracy and consistency across different client devices. However, if not handled correctly, particularly in conjunction with client-side data manipulation, it can lead to unexpected timestamps.  The primary issue stems from attempting to set a server timestamp on the client before the data is actually written to the Firestore server.  This means the server might overwrite the client's "placeholder" timestamp, possibly with an older value than expected, resulting in incorrect chronological ordering of posts.


**Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step:**

Let's assume you're building a blog post application and want to store the creation timestamp of each post.  The following code demonstrates incorrect and correct approaches:


**Incorrect Approach (Leads to potential timestamp errors):**

```javascript
// Incorrect - uses serverTimestamp() on the client before writing to Firestore.
const newPost = {
  title: 'My New Post',
  content: 'This is the content...',
  createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(), // Incorrect placement!
};

firebase.firestore().collection('posts').add(newPost)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Post added!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error adding post:', error);
  });
```

**Correct Approach (Ensures accurate server timestamps):**

```javascript
// Correct - allows Firestore server to generate the timestamp
const newPost = {
  title: 'My New Post',
  content: 'This is the content...',
};

firebase.firestore().collection('posts').add(newPost)
  .then((docRef) => {
    // Update the document with a server timestamp *after* successful creation
    docRef.update({
      createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.log('Post added with server timestamp!');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error updating timestamp:', error);
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error adding post:', error);
  });

```


**Explanation:**

The key difference lies in *when* `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` is used.  The incorrect approach attempts to set the timestamp before Firestore has a chance to handle it. The correct approach first adds the post without the timestamp, and *then*, using the returned `docRef`, updates the document to include the server-generated timestamp. This ensures the server sets the timestamp after the data is successfully written, eliminating inconsistencies.

**Conclusion:**

By utilizing the correct method shown above, developers can reliably store accurate and consistent timestamps in their Firestore database, preventing common issues associated with using `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`.  Remember that the server's timestamp is the definitive source of truth.
