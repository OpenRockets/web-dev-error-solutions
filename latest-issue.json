[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a card that visually resembles a 3D object using only CSS. We'll leverage CSS box-shadow and transforms to achieve this effect.  This example uses plain CSS3, but the principles could easily be adapted to Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe goal is to create a card that appears to be slightly elevated and angled, giving it a 3D look.  We achieve this through strategic use of box-shadow to create depth and transform to rotate the card slightly. The card will have a subtle gradient background for added visual appeal.\n\n**Full Code (CSS):**\n\n```css\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #e6f7ff, #99d9ea); /* Subtle blue gradient */\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Creates the 3D shadow */\n  transform: rotateX(3deg) rotateY(-3deg); /* Subtle 3D rotation */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing */\n  padding: 20px;\n  color: #333; /* Text color */\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n.card p {\n  margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Full Code (HTML - for context):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>3D Card</title>\n<style>\n/* CSS code from above goes here */\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <h2>My 3D Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some example text inside the 3D card. You can add more content here as needed.</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`width` and `height`:** These properties define the dimensions of the card.\n* **`background`:**  This sets a linear gradient for a visually appealing background. You can adjust the colors to your liking.\n* **`border-radius`:** This rounds the corners of the card, giving it a softer look.\n* **`box-shadow`:** This is the key to creating the 3D effect. The values `5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` represent the horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color/opacity of the shadow.  Experiment with these values to change the shadow's intensity and appearance.\n* **`transform: rotateX(3deg) rotateY(-3deg);`:** This slightly rotates the card along the X and Y axes, enhancing the 3D illusion.  Adjusting these angles will change the card's tilt.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents the card's content from overlapping the border-radius.\n* **`padding`:** Adds space between the card's border and its content.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - `box-shadow`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n* **MDN Web Docs - `transform`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (various articles on CSS effects):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
