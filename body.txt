## Description of the Error

The MongoDB `$where` operator allows you to specify JavaScript code for filtering documents. While seemingly flexible, using `$where` often leads to significant performance degradation. This is because the JavaScript execution happens within the MongoDB server, bypassing the optimized query engine and index usage. Consequently, even simple queries can become extremely slow, especially with large datasets.  The performance problem stems from the fact that the `$where` clause needs to iterate through every single document in the collection, regardless of whether indexes exist or could be leveraged.


## Fixing Step-by-Step Code

Let's consider a scenario where we have a collection named `products` with documents containing fields like `price`, `category`, and `inStock`.  We want to find all products that are both in the "Electronics" category and have a price greater than $100.  A naive approach using `$where` would be:


**Inefficient Approach (using `$where`):**

```javascript
db.products.find( { $where: "this.category == 'Electronics' && this.price > 100" } )
```

This is inefficient!  A much better approach leverages proper indexing and MongoDB's query operators:

**Efficient Approach (using Indexes and Query Operators):**

1. **Create a Compound Index:**  First, create a compound index on `category` and `price` fields to efficiently filter documents based on both criteria.

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

2. **Use Query Operators:** Now, use MongoDB's query operators `$eq` (equals) and `$gt` (greater than) for efficient filtering.

```javascript
db.products.find( { category: "Electronics", price: { $gt: 100 } } )
```

This query will utilize the compound index created in step 1, dramatically improving performance.

**Complete Example:**

```javascript
// 1. Create a sample collection (if it doesn't exist)
db.products.insertMany([
  { category: "Electronics", price: 150, inStock: true },
  { category: "Clothing", price: 50, inStock: false },
  { category: "Electronics", price: 80, inStock: true },
  { category: "Books", price: 25, inStock: true },
  { category: "Electronics", price: 200, inStock: false }
]);

// 2. Create a compound index
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } );

// 3. Inefficient query using $where (AVOID THIS!)
db.products.find( { $where: "this.category == 'Electronics' && this.price > 100" } ).forEach(printjson);

// 4. Efficient query using query operators and index
db.products.find( { category: "Electronics", price: { $gt: 100 } } ).forEach(printjson);

// 5. Check the query explain plan (optional, but recommended to verify index usage):
db.products.explain().find( { category: "Electronics", price: { $gt: 100 } } );
```

The `explain()` method provides detailed information about the query execution plan, indicating whether indexes are used.


## Explanation

The key to improving performance is to avoid `$where` whenever possible.  `$where` executes JavaScript code on the server, which is significantly slower than native MongoDB query operators.  By using appropriate indexes and query operators, MongoDB can efficiently filter data using optimized algorithms, taking full advantage of indexing for faster lookups.  Compound indexes are particularly useful for queries involving multiple fields, as seen in the example.
