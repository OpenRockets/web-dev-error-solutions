## Description of the Error

A common performance issue in MongoDB arises when using the `$lookup` stage in aggregation pipelines, especially with large datasets.  `$lookup` performs joins, similar to SQL joins, but inefficient implementation can lead to significant slowdowns or even timeouts. This often happens when the `$lookup` operation involves a large collection and lacks appropriate indexes, resulting in a full collection scan on the joined collection. The performance degrades exponentially as the data volume increases.  Symptoms include slow query execution, high CPU usage, and potentially application unresponsiveness.

## Fixing Step-by-Step Code

Let's assume we have two collections: `orders` and `customers`.  The `orders` collection contains order details, including a `customerID` field referencing the `customers` collection.  We want to retrieve order details along with the corresponding customer information using `$lookup`.

**Inefficient Query (Without Index):**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerID",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerInfo"
    }
  }
]);
```

This query, without proper indexes, will likely be slow.

**Efficient Query (With Index):**

1. **Create an Index on the `customerID` field in the `orders` collection:**

```javascript
db.orders.createIndex( { customerID: 1 } )
```

2. **Create an Index on the `_id` field in the `customers` collection (if not already present):**  `_id` is usually indexed by default, but it's worth verifying.

```javascript
db.customers.createIndex( { _id: 1 } )
```

3. **Re-run the Aggregation Pipeline:** The `$lookup` stage will now efficiently use these indexes for faster lookups.

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerID",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerInfo"
    }
  }
]);
```

**Further Optimization (for very large datasets):**

If performance remains an issue even with indexes, consider:

* **Change the `$lookup` to `$lookup` with `let` and `pipeline`:** This allows for pre-filtering in the lookup, reducing the amount of data processed:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'customers',
      let: { customerId: '$customerID' },
      pipeline: [
        { $match: { $expr: { $eq: ['$_id', '$$customerId'] } } },
        { $project: { name: 1, email: 1, _id: 0 } } //only select needed fields
      ],
      as: 'customerInfo'
    }
  }
])
```

* **Sharding:** For extremely large datasets, consider sharding your collections to distribute the data across multiple servers.
* **Data Modeling:** Review your data model to ensure it's optimized for queries.  Sometimes denormalization can improve performance.

## Explanation

The performance improvement comes from utilizing indexes.  Indexes are special data structures that MongoDB uses to quickly locate documents based on specific fields.  Without indexes, `$lookup` needs to scan the entire `customers` collection for every order, resulting in O(n*m) complexity (where n is the number of orders and m is the number of customers).  With indexes on the relevant fields, the lookup becomes significantly faster, reducing the complexity to approximately O(n log m) or even better depending on the index structure.
