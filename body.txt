## Description of the Error

Overusing MongoDB indexes, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage space consumption.  Adding too many indexes leads to increased overhead during write operations because MongoDB must update every affected index whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted. This overhead becomes especially noticeable with high write volumes.  Furthermore, each index consumes storage space, potentially leading to higher storage costs and slower backups.

The problem manifests as unexpectedly slow write operations (inserts, updates, deletes), increased storage usage, and potentially even system instability under heavy write load. You might see slow application performance or error messages related to exceeding resource limits.  Monitoring tools might highlight write times significantly exceeding read times as a key indicator.

## Fixing Step-by-Step Code Example

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with the following schema:

```json
{
  "name": "Product A",
  "description": "A great product",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 99.99,
  "manufacturer": "Company X",
  "stock": 100,
  "tags": ["electronics", "gadget", "new"]
}
```

We initially created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, `manufacturer` and `tags` (perhaps driven by various query patterns).  This might be excessive.  Let's optimize:

**Step 1: Identify Underutilized Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.stats()` command to see index usage statistics.  Look for indexes with very low usage.  If an index has very few uses, removing it can significantly improve write performance with minimal impact on read performance.

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```

This command will show you detailed statistics about your `products` collection, including index usage information. Analyze the results to determine which indexes are rarely used.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns:**

Examine your application's queries to understand how they actually use the database.  Identify the most frequent query patterns.  Focus on indexing fields that are frequently used in the `$query` part of the `find()` operations.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on the previous two steps, identify and remove indexes that are not frequently used or are redundant (indexes covering overlapping fields). For example, if `category` and `manufacturer` are rarely used separately in queries but often together, consider a compound index instead of two separate ones.

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("category_1")  // Replace "category_1" with the actual index name
db.products.dropIndex({manufacturer: 1}) //Drops index on manufacturer field
```

**Step 4: Create Optimized Compound Indexes:**

For frequent queries that involve multiple fields, consider creating compound indexes. A compound index allows faster lookups on multiple fields.  For example, a common query might look for products in a specific category with a price below a certain threshold:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This creates a compound index ordering by `category` then `price`.

**Step 5: Monitor Performance:**

After making changes, monitor your write performance using MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's performance metrics.  Verify that write speeds have improved without significantly impacting read performance for critical queries.


## Explanation

The key principle here is to balance the benefits of faster reads with the costs of slower writes and increased storage.  Over-indexing can severely tip this balance.  A well-designed indexing strategy focuses on indexing the most frequently used fields in queries and prioritizing compound indexes where multiple fields are commonly used together.  Regularly reviewing and optimizing indexes is crucial for maintaining optimal database performance in a dynamic environment.
