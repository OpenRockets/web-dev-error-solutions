# üêû MongoDB: Overuse of Indexes Leading to Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly improve query performance, creating too many indexes, or indexes on inappropriate fields, can lead to performance degradation.  This happens because writing operations (inserts, updates, deletes) become slower due to the overhead of maintaining multiple indexes.  Read operations might also suffer if the query optimizer chooses an inefficient index or a full collection scan becomes faster than using an unsuitable index.  This can manifest as slow application response times, especially during periods of high write activity.

## Fixing Step-by-Step (Illustrative Example)

Let's consider a scenario where we have a collection named "products" with fields like `productName`, `category`, `price`, `description`, and `tags` (an array).  We've indexed all of these fields individually, causing write performance issues.


**Step 1: Identify Over-Indexed Fields**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use mydatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of indexes. Analyze which indexes are actually used frequently. You can use MongoDB profiling (see external references) to see which indexes are used and which queries resulted in collection scans.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns and Usage**

Examine your application's query patterns.  Which fields are frequently used in `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, or other query operators?  Focus on the fields used in `find()` operations with filtering.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Let's assume profiling shows that indexes on `description` and `tags` are rarely used.  We'll remove them:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("description_1") // Assuming the index name is 'description_1'
db.products.dropIndex("tags_1") // Assuming the index name is 'tags_1'
```

Find the exact index names from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`.


**Step 4: Optimize Existing Indexes (Compound Index)**

If you frequently query products based on both `category` and `price`, a compound index will be much more efficient than separate indexes:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This creates a compound index on `category` (ascending) and `price` (ascending). The order matters for efficient lookups.


**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing or modifying indexes, monitor your application's performance. Use tools like MongoDB's built-in profiling or monitoring dashboards to ensure the changes improved performance.


## Explanation

Over-indexing increases the write overhead because every write operation requires updating all indexes. This slows down insertion, updates, and deletion operations.  Additionally, a large number of indexes can increase the storage space required by the collection.  The query optimizer might spend more time choosing the best index, negating any performance gains.  Properly selecting and using indexes (e.g., compound indexes, sparse indexes when applicable) is crucial for optimal performance.
