This challenge focuses on styling a multi-level nested list using Tailwind CSS.  The goal is to create a visually appealing and easily navigable nested list with clear hierarchy and consistent spacing.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes to achieve this efficiently.

**Description of the Styling:**

The nested list will feature:

* **Clear Hierarchy:**  Each level of the list will be visually distinct from the others through indentation and different styling.
* **Consistent Spacing:**  Consistent padding and margins will ensure a clean and organized appearance.
* **Visual Indicators:**  List items will use appropriate list markers (bullets or numbers) and potentially different styles for each level.
* **Tailwind CSS:**  The entire styling will be accomplished using Tailwind CSS utility classes.  No custom CSS will be written.


**Full Code:**

```html
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li class="mb-2">
    Item 1
    <ul class="list-decimal ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2">Sub-item 1.1</li>
      <li class="mb-2">Sub-item 1.2
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li class="mb-2">Sub-sub-item 1.2.1</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Sub-sub-item 1.2.2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">Item 2</li>
  <li class="mb-2">Item 3
    <ul class="list-decimal ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2">Sub-item 3.1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

**Explanation:**

* `list-disc`:  This Tailwind class applies a disc bullet point to the list items.
* `list-decimal`: This Tailwind class applies numbered list markers.
* `ml-6`: This adds margin to the left, creating indentation for nested lists.  The value `6` corresponds to a specific amount of spacing defined in Tailwind's spacing scale. You can adjust this value for different levels of indentation.
* `mb-2`: This adds a bottom margin between list items for better spacing.  Again, the value can be adjusted.

By nesting `<ul>` elements and applying these Tailwind classes strategically, we create a visually appealing and well-structured nested list.  The consistent use of Tailwind's utility classes ensures maintainability and readability.
