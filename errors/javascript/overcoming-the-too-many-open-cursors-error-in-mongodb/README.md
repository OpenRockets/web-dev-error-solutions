# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Open Cursors" Error in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

The "Too many open cursors" error in MongoDB arises when your application maintains a significantly larger number of open cursors than the configured limit.  This typically happens when cursors are created but not properly closed after use. Each open cursor consumes server resources, and exceeding the limit causes the server to reject new connection attempts or operations, resulting in application errors and performance degradation. The default limit is often low (e.g., 100), and it‚Äôs easily surpassed in applications with inefficient cursor handling.

## Fixing the Error: Step-by-Step Code Examples (Node.js Driver)

This example demonstrates how to fix the problem in a Node.js application using the official MongoDB driver.  The key is to explicitly close cursors after use.

**Problematic Code (Illustrative):**

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function findDocuments() {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
  await client.connect();
  const db = client.db('myDatabase');
  const collection = db.collection('myCollection');

  const cursor = collection.find({}); // Cursor opened, but never closed!
  const documents = await cursor.toArray(); //This implicitly closes the cursor in this specific scenario, but this is not always the case and can lead to issues

  console.log(documents);
  // ... further operations that don't close the cursor ...

  await client.close(); //This closes the client, which indirectly closes cursors, but we should be explicit for robustness
}

findDocuments();
```

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function findDocuments() {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
  await client.connect();
  const db = client.db('myDatabase');
  const collection = db.collection('myCollection');

  try{
      const cursor = collection.find({});
      const documents = await cursor.toArray(); // toArray() closes the cursor implicitly, better handled via for await loop
      console.log(documents);
  } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error while accessing data: ", e);
  } finally {
    await client.close(); //Ensures the client is always closed even with errors
  }

}


async function findDocumentsExplicitClose() {
    const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('myDatabase');
    const collection = db.collection('myCollection');
  
    try {
      const cursor = collection.find({});
      for await (const doc of cursor) {
        console.log(doc);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error while accessing data: ", e);
    } finally {
      await client.close(); // Close the client explicitly.
    }
  }


findDocumentsExplicitClose();


```

The improved code utilizes a `try...finally` block to guarantee that the client (and implicitly cursors) is always closed, even if errors occur.  The `for await...of` loop is a preferred way to iterate over a cursor, as it automatically manages cursor closing.


## Explanation

The core issue is resource management.  Each open cursor consumes a connection resource on the MongoDB server.  When many cursors remain open, the server reaches its capacity, leading to the error.  The corrected code demonstrates proper resource management by explicitly closing the client connection using `await client.close()` within a `finally` block which ensures closure irrespective of whether errors occurred during the process. The `for await...of` loop provides a more robust and cleaner method to iterate and automatically handles cursor closure.
