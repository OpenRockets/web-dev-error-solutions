[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating an interactive card that expands smoothly when hovered over, revealing additional content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its rapid prototyping capabilities and ease of styling.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will start in a compact state, displaying a title and a small image. On hover, it will smoothly expand horizontally, revealing a longer description and potentially other elements.  We'll use Tailwind's transition utilities for the animation.  The overall style will be clean and modern.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105\">\n    <img class=\"w-full h-48 object-cover\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n    <div class=\"p-4\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-800\">Card Title</h2>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-600 mt-2 line-clamp-2 hidden group-hover:block\">This is a longer description of the card.  It will be revealed when the user hovers over the card.  You can add more text here as needed to demonstrate the expanding effect.</p>\n      <button class=\"mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">Learn More</button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** This centers the card and adds padding.\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Sets a maximum width for the card.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Styles the card background, corners, and shadow.\n* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card boundaries during the transition.\n* **`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`:** Applies a smooth transition with a duration of 300ms and an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105`:** Increases the shadow and scales up the card slightly on hover.\n* **`line-clamp-2`:** Limits the number of lines shown in the description initially (using a pseudo-element or plugin that would not be part of default tailwind).  This needs to be substituted with a js approach or a css solution depending on the version of tailwind or added plugins used.\n* **`hidden group-hover:block`:** Hides the longer description initially and reveals it on hover using Tailwind's group modifier.  This requires `group` to be added as a class to the parent element.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)\n* **Learn CSS Grid:** [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)  (While not directly used here, understanding grid is valuable for layout)\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS Transitions):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
