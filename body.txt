## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB can lead to significant performance degradation, counterintuitively hindering rather than improving query speeds.  While indexes are crucial for efficient data retrieval, creating too many indexes or indexes on inappropriate fields can negatively impact write operations and storage space.  Write operations become slower because every write must update all relevant indexes. Excessive indexes also consume disk space and memory, leading to increased storage costs and potential performance issues.  The symptoms often manifest as slow write speeds, increased latency for insertion and updates, and bloated database size, even when queries appear fast.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection called `products` within a MongoDB database.  Assume we have indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and `description`. Let's say analysis reveals that the `description` index is rarely used.

**Step 1: Identify Underutilized Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection:


```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This will output a JSON array detailing all indexes, including their names and usage statistics (if available through monitoring tools). Look for indexes with low usage based on your monitoring data or profiling. In this example, let's assume the `description` index is underutilized.


**Step 2: Drop the Unnecessary Index**

Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method to remove the `description` index:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } );
```

This command drops the index on the `description` field.  The `1` indicates ascending order; if it were a compound index, you'd specify the fields accordingly (e.g., `{ description: 1, category: -1 }`).  If you are unsure of the exact index key, you can drop by name using the index name retrieved from `db.collection.getIndexes()`.


**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After dropping the index, carefully monitor write performance metrics using MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's logging. Observe write latency, throughput, and storage space utilization. If performance improves, the index removal was beneficial. If not, you might need to revisit your indexing strategy.


**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes (Optional)**

Review the remaining indexes to ensure they are optimally designed. Consider using compound indexes for queries involving multiple fields.  Avoid over-indexing; indexes only benefit frequently queried fields. If possible, choose suitable index types (like hashed indexes for equality searches).

## Explanation

Over-indexing is a common pitfall.  While indexes speed up reads, they incur overhead during writes.  The cost of maintaining indexes increases linearly with the number of indexes, and this overhead can significantly outweigh the benefits if the indexes aren't heavily used.  Identifying and dropping underutilized indexes improves write performance, reduces storage space, and boosts overall database efficiency.  A carefully planned indexing strategy that focuses on frequently used query patterns is crucial for optimal MongoDB performance.
