## Description of the Error

One common problem MongoDB developers encounter is having "too many indexes." While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, and with numerous indexes, this overhead can become substantial, ultimately slowing down the application.  The symptoms often include sluggish write performance and increased latency, while read performance might seem unaffected or only slightly improved.  MongoDB's query optimizer might also struggle to efficiently select the best index for a given query, leading to suboptimal execution plans.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing redundant or underutilized indexes.  Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with several indexes, some of which are unnecessary or rarely used.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

First, list all indexes on the `products` collection using the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and properties. Analyze this list to identify indexes that:

* **Are redundant:**  If multiple indexes cover similar query patterns, one might be sufficient.
* **Are rarely used:**  Examine your application logs or profiling data to determine index usage.  Indexes used infrequently contribute to write overhead without providing much benefit.
* **Are outdated:** Indexes created for queries that are no longer executed should be dropped.


**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified redundant or unused indexes, drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  For example, to drop an index named `_id_name_1`, you would use:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { name: 1 } )
```

Replace `{ name: 1 }` with the actual index key specification from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`.  Remember to back up your database before making any index changes.


**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, closely monitor your application's write performance. You should observe improvements in insert, update, and delete speeds.  Use MongoDB's profiling features or monitoring tools to track performance metrics and ensure the changes are beneficial.


**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes (Optional)**

Review the remaining indexes.  Consider consolidating multiple indexes into compound indexes if possible.  A compound index (e.g., `{ category: 1, price: -1 }`) can support queries on `category`, `price`, or both fields efficiently.


**Full Code Example (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// Connect to your database
use myDatabase;

// List all indexes
db.products.getIndexes().forEach(printjson);

// Example: Drop an index (replace with your actual index key)
db.products.dropIndex( { "createdAt": 1, "updatedAt":-1 } );

// List indexes again to confirm the removal
db.products.getIndexes().forEach(printjson);

// Example of creating a compound index
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: -1 } );

// List indexes after adding a compound index
db.products.getIndexes().forEach(printjson);

```

## Explanation

The key to avoiding "too many indexes" is a balanced approach. Indexes are essential for query performance, but excessively many indexes can outweigh their benefits.  The process involves careful analysis of index usage, identifying and removing redundant or underutilized indexes, and strategically creating compound indexes to cover multiple query patterns efficiently.  Regular monitoring and optimization are crucial to maintain optimal database performance.
