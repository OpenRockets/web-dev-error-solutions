**Description of the Problem:**

A common challenge when using Firebase Firestore to manage posts (e.g., blog posts, social media updates) is efficiently handling large amounts of data within each post document.  Storing extensive text, multiple images, or embedded videos directly within a single Firestore document can lead to several issues:

* **Document Size Limits:** Firestore imposes limits on document size (currently 1 MB). Exceeding this limit results in errors when trying to create or update the document.
* **Read Performance:** Retrieving large documents can significantly impact read performance, leading to slower loading times for your application.  Larger documents also consume more bandwidth.
* **Data Complexity:** Managing complex data structures within a single document can make your code harder to maintain and debug.


**Solution: Utilizing Subcollections and Storage**

The most effective strategy for handling large post data is to break down the information into smaller, manageable pieces and use a combination of Firestore subcollections and Firebase Storage.

**Step-by-Step Code (using JavaScript with Node.js):**

This example demonstrates creating a post with an image stored in Firebase Storage and related data organized in a subcollection.

**1. Setting up the Project:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
npm install firebase @firebase/storage

// Initialize Firebase
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore, collection, addDoc } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytesResumable, getDownloadURL } from "firebase/storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase config here
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);
const storage = getStorage(app);
```

**2.  Creating a Post with an Image:**

```javascript
async function createPost(postTitle, postContent, imageFile) {
  try {
    // 1. Upload the image to Firebase Storage
    const storageRef = ref(storage, `posts/${imageFile.name}`);
    const uploadTask = uploadBytesResumable(storageRef, imageFile);

    uploadTask.on('state_changed', 
      (snapshot) => {
        // Observe state change events such as progress, pause, and resume
        // Get task progress, including the number of bytes uploaded and the total number of bytes to be uploaded
        const progress = (snapshot.bytesTransferred / snapshot.totalBytes) * 100;
        console.log('Upload is ' + progress + '% done');
        switch (snapshot.state) {
          case 'paused':
            console.log('Upload is paused');
            break;
          case 'running':
            console.log('Upload is running');
            break;
        }
      }, 
      (error) => {
        // Handle unsuccessful uploads
        console.error("Upload failed:", error);
      }, 
      () => {
        // Handle successful uploads on complete
        // Get the download URL from the storage ref
        getDownloadURL(uploadTask.snapshot.ref).then((downloadURL) => {
          // 2. Store post metadata in Firestore
          addDoc(collection(db, "posts"), {
            title: postTitle,
            content: postContent,
            imageUrl: downloadURL,
            timestamp: new Date(),
          }).then((docRef) => {
            console.log("Post added with ID: ", docRef.id);
            //Optional: you can create subcollection for likes or comments here as well.
          }).catch((error) => {
            console.error("Error adding post: ", error);
          });
        });
      }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating post:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const postTitle = "My Awesome Post";
const postContent = "This is the content of my awesome post.";
const imageFile = new File(["image data"], "my-image.jpg", { type: "image/jpeg" }); // Replace with your image file.

createPost(postTitle, postContent, imageFile);
```

**Explanation:**

This code first uploads the image to Firebase Storage, then stores only the download URL of the image and other relevant metadata in a Firestore document. This keeps Firestore documents small and improves performance.
