[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating an interactive card that expands when hovered over, revealing additional content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its rapid development capabilities and ease of styling.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will initially display a concise title and a small image. On hover, the card will smoothly expand horizontally, revealing a longer description and potentially more details.  The animation will be smooth and visually appealing. We'll utilize Tailwind's transition utilities and the `hover` pseudo-class.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Expanding Card</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-105\">\n    <img class=\"w-full h-48 object-cover\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n    <div class=\"p-4\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-800\">Card Title</h2>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2 hidden group-hover:block\">\n        This is a longer description that will be revealed when the card is hovered over.  You can add more details here as needed. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** This centers the card and adds padding.\n* **`max-w-sm`:** Limits the card's maximum width.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md`:** Sets the background color, rounded corners, and shadow.\n* **`overflow-hidden`:** Prevents content from overflowing the card.\n* **`transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out`:**  Applies a smooth transition to the transform property (scale) over 300 milliseconds.\n* **`transform hover:scale-105`:** Scales the card up slightly on hover.\n* **`group-hover:block`:** This is a crucial part. Tailwind's `group` utility allows us to apply hover states to a parent element and its children.  In this case, the description paragraph is initially hidden (`hidden`) and shown only when the parent (`div` with the class `group`) is hovered over (`group-hover:block`).\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)  - The official Tailwind CSS documentation.\n* **CSS Transitions and Animations:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) - MDN documentation on CSS transitions.\n* **Understanding CSS Pseudo-classes:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) - MDN documentation on CSS pseudo-classes.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
