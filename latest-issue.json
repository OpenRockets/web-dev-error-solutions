[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a card that expands smoothly when hovered over, revealing more content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, making the styling concise and efficient.  The animation will be handled using CSS transitions.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a clean, modern design.  When the user hovers over the card, it smoothly expands horizontally to reveal additional text that is initially hidden. The expansion will be accompanied by a subtle background color change. The card will use a neutral color palette for a professional feel.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script> </head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-8\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:shadow-2xl hover:bg-gray-200\">\n    <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/400x200\" alt=\"Placeholder Image\">\n    <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n      <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Card Title</div>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n      </p>\n      <div class=\"hidden px-6 py-4 bg-gray-50 transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:block\">\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n          This is the extra content that appears on hover.

For example, `max-w-sm` sets a maximum width, `rounded` rounds the corners, `shadow-lg` adds a shadow, and `bg-gray-100` sets the background color. The `transition` and `duration` classes handle the smooth animation.  The `hover:` prefix modifies the styles on hover.\n* **Hidden Content:** The extra content is initially hidden using the `hidden` class.  On hover, the `hover:block` class makes it visible.\n* **Placeholder Image:** A placeholder image is used. You should replace `\"https://via.placeholder.com/400x200\"` with your own image URL.\n* **Responsiveness:** Tailwind CSS provides responsive design capabilities; you can adjust the styles for different screen sizes easily.\n\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)\n* **CSS Transitions Tutorial:** [Search for \"CSS Transitions Tutorial\" on your preferred search engine - many great resources are available.]\n* **Learn CSS Grid:** [Search for \"CSS Grid Tutorial\" on your preferred search engine - many great resources are available.] (While not directly used here, learning CSS Grid is invaluable for layout)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
