# üêû Overusing MongoDB Indexes: A Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can actually lead to significant performance degradation.  Adding too many indexes increases the write overhead, as every write operation must update all relevant indexes. This can slow down insertion, update, and deletion operations dramatically, outweighing the benefits of faster read times.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space, impacting storage costs and potentially slowing down overall database performance. The problem is often not immediately apparent, as the slowdowns are subtle and spread across various operations.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes from a collection called "products" with a field "category". Assume we have the following indexes:

* `{"category": 1}`
* `{"price": 1}`
* `{"category": 1, "price": 1}` (compound index)
* `{"name": 1, "description": 1}` (compound index rarely used)


**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the "products" collection:

```javascript
use myDatabase; // replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata. Analyze the query patterns of your application to identify which indexes are frequently used and which are rarely, if ever, utilized.


**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

In our example, the compound index `{"name": 1, "description": 1}` might be rarely used.  We can drop it:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"name": 1, "description": 1})
```

You can also drop the index `{"category": 1, "price": 1}` if a single index (`{"category": 1}` or `{"price": 1}`) is sufficient, which is possible if queries don't frequently combine both fields.  Always carefully consider the trade-offs between read and write performance before dropping indexes.


**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor the performance of your application using MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's logging. Pay attention to write times and overall database resource utilization.  If performance improves significantly, you've successfully identified and removed unnecessary indexes. If not, re-evaluate your indexing strategy.


**Step 4: Consider Multikey Indexes (if applicable)**

If your "category" field is an array, you might need a multikey index:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex({"category": 1})
```
This allows queries on individual elements within the array.


**Step 5: Optimize Existing Indexes**

Review existing indexes for potential optimizations:

* **Compound Index Order:** The order of fields in a compound index significantly impacts performance. The most frequently filtered field should come first.
* **Index Types:** Consider using different index types like hashed indexes for specific scenarios.

## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indices in relational databases. They create a sorted data structure that enables faster searching and retrieval of documents. However, unlike relational databases, the overhead of managing indexes in MongoDB can be more significant, especially with many indexes.  Over-indexing creates a write bottleneck.  Every write operation must update all existing indexes, leading to decreased write performance.  A careful analysis of query patterns is crucial to create a balanced and optimized index strategy.
