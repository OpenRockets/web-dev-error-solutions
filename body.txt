## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB can severely impact performance, leading to slower write operations and increased storage space consumption. While indexes are crucial for efficient query performance, creating too many or unnecessarily broad indexes can create more problems than they solve. The write operation overhead from maintaining many indexes outweighs the benefits of faster reads, particularly in frequently updated collections.  The symptoms often include slow `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations, noticeable latency spikes during write-heavy periods, and generally sluggish application response times.


## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Example)

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named "products".  Let's assume we have indexes on `name`, `price`, and `category`, but the index on `category` is rarely used.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the collection.  Analyze the usage statistics (if available) to determine which indexes are underutilized.  This often requires monitoring tools or profiling your application queries.

```javascript
use myDatabase; // Replace myDatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array containing information about all indexes, including their keys and names.  You'll need to inspect the output to identify underperforming indexes.


**Step 2: Drop the Unnecessary Index**

Once you've identified an unnecessary index (e.g., the one on `category`), you can drop it using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1 } )
```

Replace `{ category: 1 }` with the actual index key you want to remove.  The `1` indicates ascending order; use `-1` for descending.


**Step 3: Monitor Performance After Removing Index**

After dropping the index, monitor the performance of your application.  Use monitoring tools to track write times and overall database performance. Observe if write operations have significantly improved.


**Step 4 (Optional): Re-evaluate Indexing Strategy**

If the problem persists, review your query patterns and carefully re-evaluate your indexing strategy. Consider compound indexes to optimize queries that involve multiple fields. For instance, if you frequently query by both `category` and `price`, a compound index like `{ category: 1, price: 1 }` might be more beneficial.


```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```


## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB are B-tree structures that speed up data retrieval by creating sorted access paths to a specific field or set of fields.  However, every write operation (insert, update, delete) must update all indexes.  If you have many indexes, the write overhead becomes substantial, leading to performance degradation.  It's crucial to strike a balance: enough indexes to optimize read performance but not so many as to cripple write performance.  Prioritize indexes that frequently support commonly used queries.  Proper monitoring and analysis are key to effective index management.
