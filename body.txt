## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead.  Adding too many indexes, especially compound indexes, can lead to substantial slowdowns during insert, update, and delete operations. The write operations become significantly slower because MongoDB has to update all affected indexes for every modification.  This performance bottleneck can severely impact application responsiveness, especially in high-volume environments.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space, increasing storage costs and potentially impacting read performance if the indexes themselves become too large to manage efficiently.


## Fixing Step-by-Step Code Example

This example demonstrates a scenario where unnecessary indexes are created and then removed for improved performance.  We'll use the `movies` collection.

**1. Identifying Unnecessary Indexes:**

First, identify underutilized indexes using the MongoDB shell.  Run the following command to list all indexes:

```javascript
db.movies.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes on the `movies` collection. Analyze the query logs or profiling data (using `db.setProfilingLevel(2)` to enable profiling) to see which indexes are frequently used and which are rarely or never used.  Indexes with very low usage should be considered for removal.

**2. Removing Unnecessary Indexes:**

Let's assume we've identified an index on `genre` that is rarely used. We remove it using the `db.movies.dropIndex()` method:


```javascript
db.movies.dropIndex( { genre: 1 } )
```

This command removes the index on the `genre` field.  Replace `{ genre: 1 }` with the actual index specification you want to remove.

**3.  (Optional) Recreating Indexes Strategically:**

After removing unnecessary indexes, consider carefully creating new indexes if needed based on your most frequent query patterns. For instance, if you frequently query for movies by title and year, a compound index on `title` and `year` would be beneficial.


```javascript
db.movies.createIndex( { title: 1, year: 1 } )
```

This creates a compound index on both `title` (ascending) and `year` (ascending).  Choose the appropriate index type (ascending `1` or descending `-1`) based on your query requirements.

**4. Verifying the change:**

Check the indexes after dropping and creating them using:
```javascript
db.movies.getIndexes()
```

This will show the updated list of indexes. Monitor performance metrics after making changes to ensure improvements.


## Explanation

The key to efficient indexing in MongoDB (or any database) is to carefully balance the benefits of faster queries with the cost of slower writes and increased storage consumption.  Over-indexing leads to a significant performance penalty during write operations because every write requires updating all indexes.   This is especially problematic with high-volume write operations.  The cost of maintaining many indexes outweighs the benefits of slightly faster read operations when they are not frequently used.  Therefore, a thorough analysis of query patterns and usage statistics is crucial before creating indexes and regularly reviewing existing indexes to ensure they remain relevant and necessary.
