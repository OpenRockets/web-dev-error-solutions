[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing 3D card effect using only CSS. We'll leverage CSS3 properties like `box-shadow`, `transform`, and `transition` to achieve a realistic and interactive card.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe goal is to build a card that appears to have depth and slightly lifts when hovered over. This will be achieved by using strategically placed box shadows to simulate light and depth, and a subtle transform to lift the card on hover.  The card will have a clean, modern aesthetic.  We will utilize Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n<title>3D Card Effect</title>\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<style>\n.card {\n  @apply bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  @apply transform translate-y-[-5px] shadow-2xl;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100 p-10\">\n\n<div class=\"max-w-sm mx-auto\">\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-2\">My 3D Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700\">This is a simple card with a 3D effect created using only CSS.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`@apply bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out;`**: This line leverages Tailwind CSS's utility classes.  It sets the card's background to white (`bg-white`), adds a large shadow (`shadow-lg`), rounds the corners (`rounded-lg`), adds padding (`p-6`), and enables smooth transitions for the transform property (`transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out`).\n\n* **`transform translate-y-[-5px]`**: This Tailwind class translates the card 5 pixels upwards on hover, creating the lifting effect.\n\n* **`shadow-2xl`**: On hover, a larger shadow is applied (`shadow-2xl`) to enhance the 3D illusion.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) -  Learn more about using Tailwind CSS utility classes.\n* **CSS Transitions and Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - Understand how to use these CSS properties effectively.\n* **CSS Box Shadow:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Learn more about creating different shadow effects.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
