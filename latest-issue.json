[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a responsive social media card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature an image, a title, a short description, and a button. The layout should adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe social media card will use a clean and modern design. The image will be placed at the top, followed by the title, description, and finally a call-to-action button.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for easy styling and responsiveness. The card will have rounded corners, padding, and a subtle shadow for visual appeal.  The responsiveness will ensure the card looks good on both large desktops and smaller mobile screens.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Social Media Card</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n    <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Social Media Image\" class=\"rounded-t-lg w-full mb-4\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\">Awesome Post Title</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">This is a short and captivating description of the post.  It should entice the user to click the button.</p>\n    <button class=\"bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n      Learn More\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`container mx-auto p-4`:** This centers the card horizontally and adds padding.\n* **`max-w-sm`:**  This limits the card's maximum width for better responsiveness.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`:** This sets the background color, rounded corners, shadow, and padding for the card.\n* **`rounded-t-lg`:** Applies rounded top corners to the image.\n* **`text-xl font-bold mb-2`:** Styles the title.\n* **`text-gray-700 mb-4`:** Styles the description.\n* **`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`:** Styles the button with hover effect.  The `hover:` modifier changes the style on hover.\n* **`w-full`:** Makes the image take up the full width of its container.\n* **`mb-4`:** Adds margin to the bottom of elements for spacing.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)\n* **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:** [Search for \"Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet\" on Google - many helpful resources are available]\n* **Learn CSS Grid:** [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) (While this challenge uses flexbox implicitly through Tailwind, understanding CSS Grid is valuable for responsive layouts).\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
