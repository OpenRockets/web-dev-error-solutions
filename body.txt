## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is encountering performance degradation due to having too many indexes. While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an excessive number can lead to significant write performance penalties.  This happens because every write operation (insert, update, delete) needs to update all affected indexes.  With many indexes, this update process becomes a bottleneck, slowing down the application considerably.  The symptoms might include slow write operations, increased latency, and overall database sluggishness.  MongoDB's logging might not explicitly mention "too many indexes," but the performance degradation will be evident.

## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step Code and Explanation

This example demonstrates how to identify and address excessive indexes using the MongoDB shell and Compass (a GUI tool).

**Step 1: Identifying Excessive Indexes**

First, use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on a specific collection. Let's assume we're working with a collection called `products`:

```javascript
use mydatabase
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array of all indexes. Carefully examine the output.  Look for indexes that are rarely used or redundant.  Redundant indexes are those covering the same fields in a similar manner (e.g., one ascending, one descending).  Underutilized indexes are those rarely used in queries.

**Step 2: Using Compass for Visual Analysis (Optional but Recommended)**

Compass provides a visual representation of indexes.  Connect to your database in Compass, select your database and collection.  The index management section offers a clear view of existing indexes, their usage statistics (if enabled), and allows for easy deletion.


**Step 3: Removing Unnecessary Indexes**

After identifying unused or redundant indexes, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index (obtained from `db.collection.getIndexes()`).

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For example, if you have an index named `_id_`, which is a default index, you should not drop it. However if you have an index like `{"productName":1, "price":-1}` that is not used frequently, you might drop it.

```javascript
//Example droping a specific index
db.products.dropIndex({"productName":1, "price":-1}) 
```


**Step 4: Monitoring Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your database performance. You should observe an improvement in write operations.  Tools like MongoDB's profiler can help track query performance and identify bottlenecks.  Also, consider enabling index usage statistics (requires configuring some server settings) for better insights into index usage patterns.


## Explanation

The key to resolving this problem is understanding the trade-off between read and write performance.  Indexes dramatically speed up queries (reads) but add overhead to write operations.  Having many indexes, especially those rarely used, creates significant write overhead without much read performance gain.  By carefully analyzing index usage and removing unnecessary indexes, we can significantly enhance write performance and maintain acceptable query speeds.
