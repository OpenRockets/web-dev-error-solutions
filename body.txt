This challenge involves creating a glassmorphism-style card using Tailwind CSS. Glassmorphism is a design trend that uses blurred, translucent elements to create a sense of depth and modernity.  We'll build a card with a frosted glass effect, featuring a subtle background blur and a drop shadow.


## Description of the Styling

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners.  It will have a light background color with a slight blur effect to achieve the glassmorphism look.  A subtle drop shadow will be added to further enhance the 3D effect. The text content within the card will be dark and easily readable against the light background. We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient styling.

## Explanation

* **`bg-white/50`**: This sets the background color to 50% opacity white, allowing the background to show through.
* **`backdrop-blur-lg`**: This applies a large blur effect to the background behind the card, creating the frosted glass look.
* **`p-6`**: This adds padding of 6 units (using Tailwind's spacing system).
* **`rounded-lg`**: This rounds the corners of the card.
* **`shadow-lg shadow-gray-500/50`**: This adds a large drop shadow with 50% opacity gray, enhancing the 3D effect.  The `/50` provides opacity control on the shadow.
* **Other Tailwind classes**:  The rest of the classes style the text (heading, paragraph, button) using Tailwind's pre-defined styles for typography, colors, and button styles.
