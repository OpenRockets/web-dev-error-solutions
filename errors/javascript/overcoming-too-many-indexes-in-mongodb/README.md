# üêû Overcoming "Too Many Indexes" in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

The "Too Many Indexes" problem in MongoDB isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance degradation issue stemming from having an excessive number of indexes on a collection. While indexes significantly speed up queries, creating too many can lead to:

* **Slow write operations:**  Every write operation (insert, update, delete) needs to update all indexes, significantly slowing down write performance.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes consume storage space, potentially impacting overall database size and cost.
* **Increased query planning time:**  The query optimizer needs more time to choose the best index from a large pool, slowing down query execution.


## Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products` with an overly-indexed `sku` field.  Let's assume we have indexes on `sku`, `{sku: 1, price: 1}`, and `{sku: 1, category: -1}`. We'll only need to keep the compound index `{sku: 1, price: 1}`.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes:

```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array of index specifications.  For example:

```json
[
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : {
      "_id" : 1
    },
    "name" : "_id_",
    "ns" : "myDatabase.products"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : {
      "sku" : 1
    },
    "name" : "sku_1",
    "ns" : "myDatabase.products"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : {
      "sku" : 1,
      "price" : 1
    },
    "name" : "sku_1_price_1",
    "ns" : "myDatabase.products"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : {
      "sku" : 1,
      "category" : -1
    },
    "name" : "sku_1_category_-1",
    "ns" : "myDatabase.products"
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on your query patterns and analysis, remove the indexes that aren't providing significant performance benefits.  In our example, we will remove `sku_1` and `sku_1_category_-1`. We use `db.products.dropIndex()` for this:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("sku_1");
db.products.dropIndex("sku_1_category_-1");
```

**Step 3: Verify Changes**

Re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm the indexes have been dropped.

## Explanation

Too many indexes increase write overhead and consume more disk space. The query planner might also take longer to decide which index to use.  Careful index design is crucial.  Only create indexes needed for frequently used queries. Compound indexes can often replace multiple single-field indexes. Regularly review your indexes (especially as your data model evolves) and remove unused or redundant ones.

Consider using index analysis tools provided by MongoDB or third-party monitoring solutions to identify underutilized indexes.
