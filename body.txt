This document addresses a common problem developers encounter in MongoDB: having too many indexes, leading to performance degradation rather than improvement.  This issue arises primarily from a lack of understanding of index usage and the trade-offs involved.

## Description of the Error

Adding indexes improves query performance by creating sorted data structures. However, adding too many indexes can negatively impact write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because each index needs to be updated with every write.  This leads to:

* **Slower write performance:**  Significant slowdown in data modification operations.
* **Increased storage consumption:** Indexes themselves consume disk space.  Too many indexes can bloat your database.
* **Index management overhead:** MongoDB needs to manage all indexes, increasing server load.

While MongoDB doesn't throw a specific "Too Many Indexes" error, you'll notice performance issues manifesting as slow write operations and potentially increased storage usage.  Monitoring tools will reveal slow write times and large index sizes.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

The solution involves identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  This requires careful analysis of query patterns and index utilization.

**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns and Index Usage:**

Use the MongoDB profiler (or a monitoring tool like Ops Manager) to identify frequently used queries and the indexes they use.  Focus on queries with slow execution times.

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enable profiling level 2 (slow queries)

// Run your application for a while to gather data

db.system.profile.find().sort({$natural:-1}).limit(10); // Display the last 10 profiled queries
```

**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

Examine the profiling results and your application's code.  Identify indexes that aren't being utilized or are redundant. Look for the following scenarios:

* **Unused indexes:** Indexes that are never used by any queries.
* **Redundant indexes:** Multiple indexes covering similar fields (e.g., an index on `{"fieldA": 1}` and another on `{"fieldA": 1, "fieldB": 1}`). The compound index already covers queries using only `fieldA`.
* **Indexes on infrequently queried fields:** Indexes on fields rarely used in `$where` clauses or filters.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method to remove the identified indexes. Replace `<collectionName>` with your collection's name and `<indexName>` with the index name (obtained from `db.collection.getIndexes()`).


```javascript
// Remove a specific index by name
db.getCollection("<collectionName>").dropIndex("<indexName>");

// Remove an index based on its keys
db.getCollection("<collectionName>").dropIndex({fieldA: 1, fieldB: -1});
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor write performance and storage usage.  You should see improvements.

**Step 5 (Optional): Create Compound Indexes:**

If you've identified frequently used queries involving multiple fields, consider creating compound indexes to optimize them efficiently.  A compound index can support queries on any prefix of its fields.  For example:

```javascript
db.getCollection("<collectionName>").createIndex({fieldA: 1, fieldB: -1}); //compound Index
```

## Explanation

The key to managing MongoDB indexes is to find a balance between improved read performance and acceptable write performance.  Over-indexing leads to a significant write performance penalty that often outweighs any read performance gains.  Analyzing query patterns allows for creating indexes that directly benefit the most frequently used queries while minimizing the overhead of unnecessary indexes.
