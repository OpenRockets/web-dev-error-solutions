## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage space consumption.  Creating too many indexes, especially compound indexes on frequently updated fields, can lead to slow insertion, update, and deletion operations.  This is because every write operation requires updating all affected indexes, making write operations slower proportionally to the number of indexes.  Additionally, excessive indexing increases the storage overhead of the collection.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example assumes you're using the MongoDB shell.  Adjust commands as needed for your preferred driver.

Let's say we have a collection called `products` with the following schema:

```javascript
{
  "name": String,
  "category": String,
  "price": Number,
  "description": String,
  "stock": Number
}
```

And we've mistakenly created several indexes:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1, category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1, stock: 1 } )
```

We notice slow write operations.  To fix this:

**Step 1: Analyze Index Usage**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the collection:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of indexes. Analyze which indexes are rarely used based on query patterns and application logs.  Tools like MongoDB Compass can help visualize index usage.

**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

From the output of `getIndexes()`, identify indexes that aren't significantly contributing to query performance. For example, if queries rarely filter by `price` and `stock` together, the index `{"price": 1, "stock": 1}` is likely unnecessary.

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove the unnecessary indexes:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1, stock: 1 } ) //Example
db.products.dropIndex("price_1_stock_1") //Alternative using index name
```

Repeat this step for all identified unnecessary indexes.  Be cautious and only drop indexes after careful analysis.

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor the write performance of your application. You should observe an improvement in insertion, update, and deletion speeds.  Use MongoDB monitoring tools to track performance metrics.


## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB work similarly to indexes in relational databases. They improve query performance by creating a sorted structure for specific fields.  However, maintaining these sorted structures adds overhead to write operations.  When you have too many indexes, especially on frequently updated fields, the write overhead outweighs the read performance benefits.  This leads to overall performance degradation. The key is to carefully choose which indexes to create based on your most frequent query patterns.  Prioritize indexes on fields frequently used in `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc., queries. Avoid over-indexing.
