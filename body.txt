## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating sorted structures for specific fields, adding too many indexes can negatively impact write performance and database size.  Every write operation must update all relevant indexes, so an excessive number can lead to slower insertion, update, and deletion times, outweighing the benefits of faster reads.  Furthermore, excessive indexes increase the database size, requiring more storage and potentially impacting read performance due to increased disk I/O. This is especially true for write-heavy applications.  The symptoms include slow write operations and an unexpectedly large database size relative to the stored data.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates a scenario where we have excessive indexes on a collection, and we'll optimize them. Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with the following schema:

```json
{
  "productName": String,
  "category": String,
  "price": Number,
  "description": String,
  "brand": String,
  "inStock": Boolean
}
```

And we've mistakenly created indexes on all fields:

```javascript
// Incorrect: Over-indexing
db.products.createIndex( { productName: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { description: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { brand: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { inStock: 1 } )
```

**Step 1: Analyze Current Indexes**

First, let's identify the existing indexes:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes on the `products` collection.  Carefully review which indexes are actually being used. The MongoDB profiler (or monitoring tools) can help identify query patterns and which indexes are frequently utilized.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on analysis (let's assume only `productName` and `category` are frequently queried), remove unnecessary indexes:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { brand: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { inStock: 1 } )
```

**Step 3: Consider Compound Indexes**

If queries frequently involve multiple fields, create compound indexes. For example, if you often query by `category` and `price`:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This single index is more efficient than separate indexes on `category` and `price` for queries using both fields.  The order matters in compound indexes; the leading field is the most significant for sorting and query optimization.

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After optimizing your indexes, closely monitor write and read performance. Use MongoDB's profiling tools or monitoring solutions to track improvements.


## Explanation

Over-indexing increases the write overhead because MongoDB needs to update all indexes on every write operation (insert, update, delete). This slows down write performance significantly, especially on large datasets.  While read performance might initially improve with more indexes, the overall system performance will likely decrease if the write slowdown overshadows the read speedup.  Additionally, excess indexes inflate the database size, increasing storage costs and potentially causing performance issues due to increased disk I/O.  Careful index selection based on query patterns is crucial for balancing read and write performance.
