[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common performance bottleneck in MongoDB stems from issuing too many queries, often indicated by slow response times and high server load. This isn't inherently an error message but rather a symptom pointing towards inefficient database design and a lack of optimized indexing.  When queries don't utilize appropriate indexes, MongoDB performs collection scans, examining every document to find matches. This becomes exponentially slower as the collection grows.\n\n## Scenario: Slow User Search in an E-commerce Application\n\nImagine an e-commerce application where users can search for products based on name and category. Without proper indexing, a query like this:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.find({ name: /.*widget.*/i, category: \"electronics\" })\n```\n\nwill result in a full collection scan if no indexes exist on `name` or `category`.  With a large product catalog, this leads to significantly slow search times.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Fix: Creating Compound Indexes\n\nTo address this, we need to create a compound index encompassing both `name` and `category`. This allows MongoDB to efficiently locate documents matching both criteria simultaneously.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Query Pattern**\n\nDetermine the common query patterns used to retrieve data. In this case, it's finding products based on `name` (with partial matches) and `category`.\n\n**Step 2: Create the Compound Index**\n\nThe following command creates a compound index on `name` (text index for partial match support) and `category`:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.createIndex( { name: \"text\", category: 1 } )\n```\n\n* `name: \"text\"` creates a text index on the `name` field, enabling efficient text searches including partial matches (using regular expressions or $text operator).\n* `category: 1` creates an ascending index on the `category` field.  The order matters for compound indexes; adjust to descending (`-1`) if needed.\n\n**Step 3: Verify Index Creation**\n\nConfirm the index was created successfully:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.getIndexes()\n```\n\nThis will list all indexes on the `products` collection.  You should see the newly added compound index.\n\n**Step 4: Re-run the Query**\n\nExecute the search query again:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.find({ name: /.*widget.*/i, category: \"electronics\" })\n```\n\nThis time, MongoDB should leverage the newly created index, resulting in significantly faster query execution.  You can monitor query execution time using the `explain()` method:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.find({ name: /.*widget.*/i, category: \"electronics\" }).explain()\n```\n\nLook for the \"executionStats\" section within the output.  A \"winningPlan\" using the index instead of a collection scan is the desired outcome.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nBy creating a compound index on `name` and `category`, we enable MongoDB to directly access relevant documents without scanning the entire collection.  The text index on `name` supports efficient partial string matching, while the ascending index on `category` further refines the search.  Choosing the right index type is crucial for optimal performance, based on the data type and query patterns.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **MongoDB Documentation on Indexing:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)\n* **MongoDB Documentation on Text Indexes:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-text/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-text/)\n* **MongoDB Query Optimization Guide:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-optimization/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-optimization/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
