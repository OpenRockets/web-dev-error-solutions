# üêû Overusing MongoDB Indexes: A Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead.  Adding too many indexes leads to increased write times as MongoDB must update all affected indexes every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This can severely impact application responsiveness, especially in high-write environments.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space, leading to higher storage costs and potentially impacting read performance due to increased I/O operations.


## Full Code of Fixing Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  There's no single "fix" code; the process is iterative and requires analysis.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

```bash
db.collectionName.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all indexes on the specified collection.  Replace `collectionName` with your collection's name.

**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns:**

Examine your application's MongoDB queries using the MongoDB profiler or logging. This helps identify frequently used query patterns and the fields they target.

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enable profiling
// ...your application queries...
db.system.profile.find({ "ns" : "yourDatabase.yourCollection" }).sort( { ts : -1 } ) // Analyze profile results
db.setProfilingLevel(0) // Disable profiling

```

**Step 3: Identify Unused Indexes:**

Compare the indexes listed in Step 1 with the frequently used query patterns identified in Step 2.  Indexes not used in frequent queries are candidates for removal.


**Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.collectionName.dropIndex()` command to remove identified unnecessary indexes.

```bash
// Example: Remove an index on the 'name' field.
db.collectionName.dropIndex( { name: 1 } )

//Example: Remove an index by its name
db.collectionName.dropIndex("name_1")
```

**Step 5: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor the write performance and storage usage of your collection. You can use MongoDB monitoring tools or metrics to observe the impact.


## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They speed up queries by creating a sorted structure on specific fields. However,  every write operation needs to update these structures; too many indexes increase write overhead.  The key is to create indexes only on fields frequently used in query filters, sort criteria, and projections.  Using compound indexes (indexes on multiple fields) can be more efficient than multiple single-field indexes if queries frequently use combinations of those fields.  Regularly review and optimize indexes based on changing query patterns.  Over time, applications evolve, and indexes once useful can become obsolete or even detrimental.
