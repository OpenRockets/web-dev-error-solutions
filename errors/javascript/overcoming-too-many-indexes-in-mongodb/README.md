# üêû Overcoming "Too Many Indexes" in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

One common problem developers face in MongoDB is the "too many indexes" issue.  This doesn't manifest as a specific error message but rather as performance degradation.  Having excessive indexes can severely impact write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because MongoDB needs to update all affected indexes for every write.  While indexes speed up reads, an overabundance can negate this benefit, leading to slower overall performance and increased storage consumption.  The symptoms might include significantly slower write speeds, increased database latency, and ultimately, application slowdowns.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example demonstrates identifying and addressing excessive indexes using the MongoDB shell.  There's no single "fix" code, as the solution involves analysis and careful index removal.

**1. Identify Unused Indexes:**

First, we need to identify indexes that are not actively contributing to query performance.  This often requires analyzing your application's query patterns.  MongoDB's profiling feature can help here.  Let's assume, based on profiling, that the `inactive_index` below is not being used.

```javascript
// Enable profiling (adjust level as needed, 2 is a good starting point for diagnosis)
db.setProfilingLevel(2)

// ... run your application for a while ...

// Check the profiler for query patterns.  If an index isn't used frequently, consider removal
db.system.profile.find({ "op": "query" }).sort({ts: -1}).limit(100).forEach(printjson)

//Disable profiling when done (crucial to avoid performance impact)
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```

**2. Drop the Unused Index:**

Once you've identified an unused index (e.g., `inactive_index`), you can drop it:

```javascript
db.collectionName.dropIndex("inactive_index") 
// Replace collectionName and inactive_index with your actual values.
// You can get the index name from `db.collectionName.getIndexes()`
```

**3. Verify the Impact (Optional):**

After dropping an index, run performance tests to assess the impact. This might involve using a load testing tool to simulate real-world usage and measure write speeds, query latency, etc.

**4. Regularly Review Indexes:**

Index management should be an ongoing process. Periodically review your indexes and consider dropping or updating indexes that are no longer efficient.


## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They are special data structures that improve query performance by providing quick lookups of data. However, they come with an overhead: each write operation requires updating every relevant index, which adds to the write time.  Having too many indexes will significantly increase this overhead, slowing down writes disproportionately more than it speeds up reads. The key is to strike a balance ‚Äì use only the indexes that are necessary for frequently executed queries.  Regularly review your indexes based on your application's evolving query patterns.
