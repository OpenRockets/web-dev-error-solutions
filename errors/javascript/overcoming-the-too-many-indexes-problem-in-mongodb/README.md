# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB, particularly in larger deployments, is having too many indexes.  While indexes dramatically improve query performance, an excessive number can lead to significant performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, and with too many indexes, this update process becomes a bottleneck, slowing down your application.  The symptoms might include:

* **Slow write performance:**  Inserting, updating, or deleting documents takes considerably longer than expected.
* **High write latency:**  Applications experience noticeable delays when performing write operations.
* **Increased server load:** The MongoDB server's CPU and I/O utilization spikes during write operations.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address excessive indexing on a collection named `products` with fields like `productName`, `category`, `price`, and `tags` (an array).  Let's assume we've identified overly numerous indexes impacting write performance.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, list all indexes on the `products` collection using the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method:

```javascript
use myDatabase; // Replace myDatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  Analyze the output to identify redundant or underutilized indexes.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

MongoDB provides tools to analyze index usage. One approach is to use the `db.collection.stats()` method combined with monitoring write operations:

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```

This provides information about the collection, including the number of documents and the size of the collection.  Monitor write operation performance (e.g., using your application's logging or profiling tools) before and after removing indexes to see the impact.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

After identifying redundant or underperforming indexes (those not frequently used in queries), remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method. For example, if we have an index on `productName` that's not providing significant performance gains:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("productName_1") // Replace "productName_1" with the actual index name
```

**Step 4: Re-evaluate and Iterate:**

After dropping indexes, carefully monitor the write performance. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed. Remember, removing an index might impact read performance on specific queries using that index, so carefully weigh the trade-offs between read and write performance.  You may need to create new, more efficient compound indexes if necessary (combining multiple fields).

**Step 5: Consider Compound Indexes:**

Instead of having separate indexes for each field, create compound indexes that cover common query patterns. For example, if you frequently query by `category` and `price`, create a compound index:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This single index can support queries filtering by `category` alone, `price` alone, or both.

## Explanation

Having too many indexes leads to performance bottlenecks because each write operation needs to update all indexes. This overhead becomes significant as the number of indexes and the document size increase.  The strategy involves carefully analyzing index usage, removing unnecessary indexes, and creating efficient compound indexes to optimize query performance while mitigating the negative impact on write operations. Focusing on frequently used query patterns in creating indexes is crucial.
