[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a responsive layout of cards using CSS. The goal is to display cards in multiple columns on larger screens and switch to a single column on smaller screens, ensuring a clean and visually appealing design. We'll achieve this using CSS Grid for its powerful layout capabilities.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe layout consists of several cards, each containing an image, a title, and a short description.  On larger screens (above 768px), the cards will be arranged in a three-column grid.  On smaller screens, the layout will seamlessly transition to a single-column layout, stacking the cards vertically.  The cards will have a consistent spacing between them and will be visually appealing with rounded corners, shadows, and subtle hover effects.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Responsive Multi-column Cards</title>\n<style>\nbody {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  margin: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); /* Responsive columns */\n  grid-gap: 20px;\n}\n\n.card {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: transform 0.2s ease; /* Smooth hover effect */\n}\n\n.card img {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-5px); /* subtle lift on hover */\n}\n\n/* Small screen adjustments (single column) */\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  .card-container {\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Single column */\n  }\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card-container\">\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Card Image 1\">\n    <h3>Card Title 1</h3>\n    <p>This is a short description for card 1.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Card Image 2\">\n    <h3>Card Title 2</h3>\n    <p>This is a short description for card 2.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Card Image 3\">\n    <h3>Card Title 3</h3>\n    <p>This is a short description for card 3.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Card Image 4\">\n    <h3>Card Title 4</h3>\n    <p>This is a short description for card 4.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));` line is key to the responsive layout.  `repeat(auto-fit, ...)` allows the grid to automatically adjust the number of columns based on available space. `minmax(300px, 1fr)` ensures that each column is at least 300px wide but also allows them to grow proportionally to fill available space.\n*   The `@media (max-width: 768px)` section applies styles specifically for smaller screens, switching to a single-column layout.\n*   Other styles handle card appearance (background, shadows, hover effects).\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n*   **CSS Grid Layout:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)\n*   **CSS Media Queries:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
