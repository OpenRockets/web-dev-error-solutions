[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a modern-looking product card using Tailwind CSS. The card will feature an image, title, description, and a call-to-action button. We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient and responsive styling.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will have a clean and minimalist design.  It will be responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes. The image will be displayed prominently at the top, followed by the title, a short description, and a button to encourage user interaction.  We'll use a subtle shadow and rounded corners to give it a modern feel.  The color palette will be neutral and easy on the eyes.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Product Card</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg mx-auto my-10 bg-white\">\n    <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Product Image\">\n    <div class=\"px-6 py-4\">\n      <div class=\"font-bold text-xl mb-2\">Product Title</div>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
