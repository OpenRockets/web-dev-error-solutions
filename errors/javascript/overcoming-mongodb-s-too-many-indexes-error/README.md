# üêû Overcoming MongoDB's "too many indexes" Error


## Description of the Error

The "too many indexes" error, while not a specific MongoDB error message, represents a situation where a collection has an excessive number of indexes, leading to performance degradation rather than improvement.  This isn't a direct error thrown by the MongoDB server, but a performance bottleneck you'll encounter.  Too many indexes increase the write operations overhead significantly, as each write operation needs to update all the indexes.  Reads might also slow down if the query optimizer struggles to choose the most efficient index.  This often manifests as slow query execution times and high write latency.

## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products`.  We'll assume you have a MongoDB instance running and the `products` collection populated.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

```bash
mongo
use your_database_name  // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all the indexes on the `products` collection. You'll see a JSON output similar to this:

```json
[
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "_id" : 1 },
    "name" : "_id_",
    "ns" : "your_database_name.products"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "category" : 1, "price" : 1 },
    "name" : "category_1_price_1",
    "ns" : "your_database_name.products"
  },
  {
    "v" : 2,
    "key" : { "price" : -1 },
    "name" : "price_-1",
    "ns" : "your_database_name.products"
  },
  // ... more indexes
]
```


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage:**

Use the MongoDB Profiler to see which indexes are actually used. This will help you identify unused or rarely used indexes.

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enables profiling level 2 (all operations)
// Run your application queries
db.system.profile.find()  // Inspect the profiler results
```

Look at the `ns`, `query`, and `indexUsed` fields within the profiler output. Identify indexes frequently listed in `indexUsed`, and those never (or rarely) used.


**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified indexes that are not contributing to query performance, you can drop them.  Let's say you decide to drop the `category_1_price_1` index:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("category_1_price_1")
```

Repeat this step for all unnecessary indexes you identified.  Always be cautious; double check the index name before dropping it.


**Step 4: Verify Changes:**

After dropping the indexes, run `db.products.getIndexes()` again to confirm that the unnecessary indexes have been removed.  Monitor your application's performance to ensure that the changes have improved performance.

**Step 5 (Optional): Re-evaluate Indexing Strategy:**

If you're still experiencing performance issues, consider a more comprehensive review of your indexing strategy. You might need to create composite indexes or use different index types to optimize your query patterns.



## Explanation

Having too many indexes increases the storage overhead and significantly slows down write operations because every write needs to update all the indexes. The query optimizer might also struggle to choose the most efficient index when faced with a large number of options.  This results in slower queries and reduced overall database performance.  By dropping unused indexes, you reduce this overhead, leading to performance improvements.

The profiler is crucial for determining index utility. It provides insights into which indexes are actually utilized by your queries. Relying on intuition alone might lead you to drop valuable indexes unintentionally.
