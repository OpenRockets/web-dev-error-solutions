# üêû Overusing MongoDB Indexes: Performance Bottleneck and Solution


## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB can severely impact write performance. While indexes dramatically speed up read operations by optimizing query searches, creating too many indexes or indexes on inappropriate fields leads to significant write overhead.  Every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, and with numerous indexes, this overhead becomes substantial, potentially slowing down your application and increasing latency. This is especially problematic with high-write workloads.  You might observe slow insertion, update, or deletion times, alongside increased resource consumption (CPU and I/O).


## Full Code of Fixing Step by Step

This example demonstrates identifying and mitigating over-indexing on a collection named `products` with fields `name` (string), `category` (string), `price` (number), and `description` (string). We'll assume an overly indexed collection as a starting point.


**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all existing indexes:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array of index specifications.  Examine the output to identify redundant or unnecessary indexes.


**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns**

Review your application's MongoDB queries. Identify frequently used queries and the fields they filter on. This will reveal which indexes are truly beneficial. Tools like MongoDB Compass can assist with query analysis.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes rarely used or redundant to others (e.g., an index on `name` and another on `{ name: 1, category: 1}` where the latter covers the former's functionality), remove them using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command.  For example, to drop an index named `name_1`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("name_1")
```
To drop an index with specific fields:
```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { name: 1 } )
```


**Step 4: Optimize Existing Indexes**

After removing unnecessary indexes, review the remaining ones. Consider if compound indexes could replace multiple single-field indexes.  For example, if your queries frequently filter by `category` and then `price`, a compound index `{ category: 1, price: 1 }` is more efficient than separate indexes on `category` and `price`.


**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After making index changes, monitor write performance using monitoring tools or by measuring insertion/update/deletion times in your application.  Observe the impact of your changes on both write and read operations. You might need to iterate and fine-tune your indexing strategy based on your findings.


## Explanation

Over-indexing is a classic case of optimization gone wrong. While indexes improve read speeds, the cost of maintaining them during writes can outweigh the benefit.  Strategic index management requires a thorough understanding of your application's query patterns and careful consideration of write vs. read workloads.  Focusing on frequently used queries and creating efficient compound indexes is key to avoiding performance bottlenecks.
