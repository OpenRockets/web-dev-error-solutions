# üêû CSS Challenge:  3D-like Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this through clever use of shadows, transforms, and hover effects.  The card will contain an image and some text.


## Description of the Styling

The card will have a clean, modern look.  It will be slightly elevated from the background using a box shadow. On hover, the card will subtly scale up and the shadow will become more pronounced, giving a 3D "lift" effect.  The image within the card will be rounded at the corners.  Tailwind's utility classes will make this styling concise and efficient.

## Explanation

* **`bg-white`**: Sets the card background to white.
* **`rounded-lg`**: Applies a large border radius for rounded corners.
* **`shadow-md shadow-gray-400`**: Adds a medium-sized gray shadow.
* **`hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105`**:  On hover, increases the shadow size and scales the card up slightly.
* **`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`**:  Adds a smooth transition effect.
* **`rounded-t-lg`**: Rounds the top corners of the image.
* **`w-full h-48 object-cover`**: Makes the image fill the available width and height, covering the entire space.  `object-cover` ensures the entire area is covered, potentially cropping the image.
* **Other Tailwind classes**:  Standard classes for padding (`p-4`), text styling (`text-xl`, `font-bold`, `text-gray-700`), and margins (`mb-2`) are used for layout and visual appeal.
