# üêû MongoDB: Overlapping Indexes and Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common performance issue in MongoDB arises from creating overlapping indexes.  Overlapping indexes, where one index is a subset of another, lead to wasted storage space and increased write times.  While reads might seem unaffected initially, MongoDB's query optimizer might not always choose the most efficient index, leading to performance degradation on read operations, especially with complex queries.  This is particularly noticeable with large datasets.  The problem manifests as slow query execution times, even if appropriate indexes seem to exist.

## Code Example & Fixing Steps (Illustrative)

Let's say we have a collection named `products` with fields `category`, `subcategory`, and `price`.  We initially create two indexes:

```javascript
// Initial (incorrect) indexes
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, subcategory: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
```

The second index (`{ category: 1 }`) is a subset of the first (`{ category: 1, subcategory: 1 }`). This is an example of overlapping indexes.  To fix this, we should remove the redundant index:

**Step 1: Identify Overlapping Indexes**

Use the `db.adminCommand( { listIndexes: "products" } )` command to list all indexes on the `products` collection.  This will reveal the overlapping indexes.


**Step 2: Drop the Redundant Index**

In our example, the index ` { category: 1 } ` is redundant. We drop it using:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1 } )
```

**Step 3: Verify the change**

Re-run `db.adminCommand( { listIndexes: "products" } )` to confirm that only the necessary index remains.


**Step 4: Optimize Query Performance (Optional)**

After removing the redundant index, you might need to optimize the queries. If your queries frequently filter based on both `category` and `subcategory` while sometimes only on `category`, then a compound index like `{ category: 1, subcategory: 1 }` might be suitable.  However, if queries focusing on just `category` are common, you could consider having a separate `category` index that can improve performance for those.


**Revised Index Strategy (example):**

Consider the frequency of your queries and choose between these strategies:

* **Strategy 1 (if queries on `category` alone are infrequent):** Keep only ` { category: 1, subcategory: 1 } `.
* **Strategy 2 (if queries on `category` alone are frequent):**  Use separate indexes: ` { category: 1 } ` and ` { category: 1, subcategory: 1 } `.

This decision requires careful analysis of your application's query patterns.  Using a tool like MongoDB Compass can help visualize and profile your queries to see the index usage and make an informed decision.

## Explanation

Overlapping indexes cause performance degradation because:

* **Increased Storage:** MongoDB stores each index separately, wasting disk space.
* **Slower Write Operations:** Every write operation requires updating all indexes, increasing write latency.
* **Query Optimizer Complexity:** The query optimizer has more indexes to consider, potentially leading to less optimal query plan selection.

Removing redundant indexes reduces storage requirements, speeds up write operations and simplifies the query optimizer's task.
