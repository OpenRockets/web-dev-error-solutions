## Description of the Error

A common performance issue arises when using MongoDB's `$lookup` aggregation pipeline stage for joining collections.  If the collections involved are large and lack appropriate indexes, the `$lookup` operation can become incredibly slow, leading to application slowdowns and user frustration.  The problem manifests as significantly increased query execution times, potentially resulting in timeouts or application unresponsiveness.  This is especially problematic when dealing with many-to-many relationships where the joined collections have a large number of documents.

## Fixing Step-by-Step with Code

Let's assume we have two collections: `orders` and `customers`.  The `orders` collection contains order information, and the `customers` collection contains customer details.  Each order is linked to a customer via a `customerID` field.  The following naive `$lookup` query can be extremely inefficient:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerID",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerDetails"
    }
  }
])
```

**Step 1: Create Index on the `customerID` field in the `orders` collection.**  This index significantly speeds up the lookup process by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate matching documents in the `orders` collection based on the `customerID`.

```javascript
db.orders.createIndex( { customerID: 1 } )
```

**Step 2: Create Index on the `_id` field in the `customers` collection (if one doesn't already exist).**  While often implicitly indexed, explicitly creating it ensures optimal performance.

```javascript
db.customers.createIndex( { _id: 1 } )
```

**Step 3: Re-run the `$lookup` aggregation.**  Now, with the correct indexes in place, the `$lookup` should execute considerably faster.

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerID",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerDetails"
    }
  }
])
```

**Step 4 (Optional - for very large datasets): Consider using `$lookup` with a `let` and `pipeline` for optimized filtering:**  If you need to filter results further, you can use the `let` and `pipeline` operators within `$lookup` to reduce the size of the data before joining.  This can help even more with performance especially if you are only interested in a subset of customer information.

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      let: { customerId: "$customerID" },
      pipeline: [
        { $match: { $expr: { $eq: ["$_id", "$$customerId"] }, isActive: true } }, //Additional Filter
        { $project: { name: 1, email: 1, _id: 0 } } // only retrieve relevant fields
      ],
      as: "customerDetails"
    }
  }
])
```

## Explanation

The core issue is the lack of appropriate indexes.  Without indexes, MongoDB needs to perform a full collection scan on either the `orders` or `customers` collection for every document in the other collection, which is computationally expensive (O(n*m) where n and m are the sizes of the collections). By creating indexes on the join fields (`customerID` and `_id`), MongoDB can efficiently locate matching documents using index lookups (significantly faster, closer to O(log n) or O(1) in optimal scenarios). This dramatically reduces the execution time of the `$lookup` operation.  The optional filtering further reduces the volume of data processed, leading to enhanced performance.
