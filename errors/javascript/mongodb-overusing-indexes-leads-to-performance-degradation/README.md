# üêû MongoDB: Overusing Indexes Leads to Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up query performance, adding too many indexes, especially compound indexes with many fields, can lead to severe performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes). This happens because every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, and with many indexes, this overhead can outweigh the benefits gained from faster reads.  The symptom is often slow inserts and updates, even though read operations might seem fast.  The database may also become bloated due to increased index size.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with several indexes, some of which are redundant or rarely used.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all existing indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use mydatabase; // Replace 'mydatabase' with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a JSON array of index specifications. Analyze the output carefully. Look for indexes that:

* **Are rarely used:** Check your application logs or MongoDB monitoring tools to identify indexes that are not frequently used in queries.
* **Are redundant:**  Check if the selectivity of one index overlaps significantly with another. If one index covers most of the query patterns another index addresses, the latter is redundant.
* **Have high cardinality:**  Indexes on fields with many unique values can be expensive to maintain.
* **Are too broad (compound indexes):** Compound indexes with many fields can become very large and slow down writes without a significant improvement in read performance.


**Step 2: Drop Redundant Indexes**

Once you've identified unnecessary indexes, you can drop them using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command. Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index (as shown in the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`):

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```
For example, if you identified an index named `_id_1_price_1` as redundant:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("_id_1_price_1")
```

**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor your application's performance.  Use MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's logging to track write operation times and overall database performance. If you experience performance improvements, it confirms that the dropped indexes were indeed unnecessary. If write performance did not improve substantially or if it worsened, re-evaluate your index strategy and consider alternative approaches.


## Explanation

Over-indexing is a common anti-pattern in NoSQL databases like MongoDB.  While indexes accelerate query performance, they add overhead to write operations.  Each write needs to update all relevant indexes.  The write overhead increases proportionally to the number of indexes.  Therefore, it's crucial to carefully select which indexes to create, prioritize frequently used queries, and drop redundant or rarely used indexes. A good strategy is to start with only essential indexes and add more only when necessary, after profiling the application's query patterns.
