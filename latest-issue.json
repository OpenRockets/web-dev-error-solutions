[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card that gives the illusion of depth using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this effect through clever use of shadows, transformations, and layering.  No complex JavaScript is required.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will be a rectangular shape with a subtle, realistic 3D effect.  Key styling elements include:\n\n*   A light background color.\n*   A soft, inner shadow to create a recessed look.\n*   A darker, outer shadow to give the impression of depth.\n*   A slight elevation using `translateZ`.\n*   Rounded corners for a softer feel.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"w-64 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl shadow-gray-400/50 transform transition duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-2xl  \">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/350x150\" alt=\"Card Image\" class=\"rounded-t-lg w-full\">\n  <div class=\"p-4\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-lg font-bold mb-2\">Card Title</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      This is a sample card description.  You can add more details here.\n    </p>\n    <button class=\"bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mt-4\">\n      Learn More\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `w-64`: Sets the width of the card to 64 units (Tailwind's utility classes).\n*   `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.\n*   `rounded-lg`: Applies large rounded corners.\n*   `shadow-xl shadow-gray-400/50`: Creates a large shadow with a 50% opacity gray color. This is the main shadow giving depth.\n*   `transform transition duration-300`: Enables smooth transitions for hover effects.\n*   `hover:scale-105`: Slightly increases the scale on hover, enhancing the 3D feel.\n*   `hover:shadow-2xl`:  Increases shadow size on hover for emphasis.\n*   `rounded-t-lg`: Applies large rounded corners to the top of the image within the card.\n*   The inner `<div>` with `p-4` adds padding to the content area.\n*   Tailwind's pre-defined classes are used for typography (`text-lg`, `font-bold`, etc.) and button styling.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n*   **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  — The official Tailwind CSS documentation is an excellent resource for learning about all of its utility classes and features.\n*   **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:** Search for \"Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet\" on Google to find numerous cheat sheets that can help you quickly find the utility classes you need.\n*   **MDN Web Docs (CSS):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) — A comprehensive resource for learning CSS fundamentals.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
