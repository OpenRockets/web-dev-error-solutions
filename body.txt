## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB development is encountering performance degradation despite having indexes. This often stems from having *too many* indexes. While indexes speed up queries, excessive indexes can negatively impact write performance (insertion, update, deletion operations).  Each index adds overhead during write operations, as MongoDB needs to update all relevant indexes whenever data is modified.  This overhead can significantly slow down write performance, potentially outweighing the benefits of faster reads.  The database can become sluggish, and applications relying on it may experience noticeable delays.  The `mongostat` utility might reveal slow write operations.

## Fixing the "Too Many Indexes" Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address excessive indexes using MongoDB Compass (GUI) and the `mongo` shell (CLI).

**Step 1: Identify Excessive Indexes (MongoDB Compass)**

1. Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.
2. Navigate to the collection experiencing performance issues.
3. Click on the "Indexes" tab.
4. Review the list of existing indexes.  Look for indexes that are rarely or never used.  Consider the following:
    * **Redundant indexes:**  Do you have multiple indexes covering similar query patterns?
    * **Unused indexes:** Are there indexes that haven't been utilized in recent queries (check your query logs)?
    * **Overly specific indexes:** Are there compound indexes with too many fields, leading to high storage overhead and potentially low selectivity?

**Step 2: Identify Excessive Indexes (MongoDB Shell)**

1. Connect to your MongoDB instance using the mongo shell: `mongo <database_name>`
2. List all indexes for a specific collection:  `db.<collection_name>.getIndexes()`
3. Analyze the output.  Use the `db.collection.stats()` command to see storage size of the collection and indexes, helping you to identify indexes that take up significant space and are infrequently used.

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes (MongoDB Shell)**

Once you've identified indexes to remove, use the following command to drop them:

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

Replace `<collection_name>` with the name of your collection and `<index_name>` with the name of the index to drop.  For example:

```javascript
db.users.dropIndex("email_1_username_1") // Drops the index named "email_1_username_1"
```

You can also drop indexes based on their keys. For example, to drop an index on field "email":

```javascript
db.users.dropIndex({email: 1})
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance (MongoDB Shell & Compass)**

After dropping indexes, monitor your database's performance using `mongostat` (command-line) or the performance monitoring tools within MongoDB Compass to verify that write performance has improved.  Use `db.collection.stats()` to check collection size to observe the index size reduction.

## Explanation

The root cause is the trade-off between read and write performance. While indexes speed up queries (reads), they add overhead to write operations.  Each index must be updated for every insert, update, or delete.  Too many indexes, especially those rarely used or redundant, cause significant write-performance bottlenecks without providing commensurate read-speed improvements.  Identifying and removing unused or redundant indexes optimizes the balance, leading to better overall database performance.
