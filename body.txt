**Description of the Error:**

Over-indexing in MongoDB can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead without necessarily improving read performance.  While indexes speed up queries, creating too many indexes, especially compound indexes with many fields, can lead to:

* **Slow write operations:** Every write operation requires updating all affected indexes.  Many indexes mean significantly more update overhead.
* **Increased storage space consumption:** Indexes themselves consume storage, and too many indexes can lead to a substantial increase in disk usage.
* **Diminishing returns:** After a certain point, adding more indexes yields minimal performance improvement, making the added overhead counterproductive.
* **Index fragmentation:**  Frequent updates to many indexes can lead to fragmentation, further reducing performance.


**Code Example (Illustrative – Fixing depends on specific situation):**

Let's say we have a collection `users` with many indexes, impacting write performance. We'll focus on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

```bash
db.users.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all indexes on the `users` collection.  Examine the output to identify indexes that are rarely or never used.  You can analyze MongoDB's slow query log for insights into query patterns.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Suppose we find an index `{"lastName": 1, "age": 1, "city": 1}` is rarely used based on query analysis and slow query logs. We remove it using:

```javascript
db.users.dropIndex({"lastName": 1, "age": 1, "city": 1})
```

Repeat this for other unused or redundant indexes.  Consider combining multiple simpler indexes into a more efficient compound index if possible.  For example, if you have separate indexes on `lastName` and `age`, a compound index on `{"lastName": 1, "age": 1}` might suffice and be more efficient than the two separate indexes.

**Step 3: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor write performance metrics (e.g., using MongoDB's monitoring tools or a monitoring service) to ensure improvements.  If performance doesn't improve, re-evaluate your indexing strategy.


**Explanation:**

The key to efficient indexing is to create indexes only for frequently accessed fields used in crucial queries.  Analyze your application's query patterns using profiling and slow query logs to identify which indexes are most beneficial.  Avoid creating indexes on infrequently used fields or fields with high cardinality (many unique values).  Compound indexes can be powerful but should be carefully designed to avoid excessive overhead. A good strategy is to start with indexes for the most frequently used query patterns and add more incrementally, monitoring performance at each step.
