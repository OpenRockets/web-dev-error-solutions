## Description of the Error

The "too many indexes" error isn't a specific MongoDB error message but rather a performance problem stemming from having an excessive number of indexes on a collection.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an overabundance can significantly degrade write performance.  This is because every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all relevant indexes, adding overhead and slowing down your application.  You'll notice this as slower write operations, increased latency, and potentially even application slowdowns or timeouts.  You might not see a specific error message, but rather a general performance bottleneck.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing redundant or underutilized indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, we need to list all the indexes currently defined on your collection.  Let's assume your collection is called "products".  Use the following MongoDB shell command:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of index documents, showing the keys, uniqueness, and other properties of each index.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

The next step is crucial but often overlooked.  You need to determine which indexes are actually being used and which are not. The most effective way to achieve this is by using MongoDB's profiling capabilities. Enable profiling:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2)
```

Run your application for a while to generate some profiling data.  Then, query the profiling collection:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({ "ns": "yourDatabase.products", "op": { $in: ["query", "getmore"] } }).sort( {ts: -1} ).limit(100)
```
Replace `"yourDatabase.products"` with the actual name of your database and collection.  This will show recent queries and their performance, highlighting indexes used (or not used). Look for queries that are slow and don't utilize any index (indicated by `scanAndOrder` execution).

**Step 3: Removing Redundant or Unused Indexes**

Based on your analysis, identify indexes that are redundant (e.g., you have indexes on `{"fieldA": 1}` and `{"fieldA": -1}` when one is sufficient) or have never (or very rarely) been used.  You can remove these indexes using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command.  For example, to drop an index on `fieldA`:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { "fieldA": 1 } )
```

Or, to drop an index by name (if you know it):

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("fieldA_1")
```

**Step 4: Re-evaluate and Monitor**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance.  Track write operations and query times.  If you encounter performance issues with specific queries, you might need to create new, more optimized indexes.  Remember to carefully plan your indexes. Don't just add them randomly; consider query patterns and data access frequency.


## Explanation

The performance degradation from excessive indexes is primarily due to the write overhead.  Each write needs to update all indexes, adding significant time complexity, especially with large datasets or high write throughput.  By carefully analyzing index usage and removing redundant or unused ones, you reduce this overhead, improving write performance and overall application responsiveness.  Profiling is key for identifying which indexes are truly valuable.
