[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nDevelopers often encounter issues when storing large amounts of data, particularly rich media like images within their posts in Firestore.  Firestore has document size limits (currently 1 MB).  Attempting to store large images directly within a Firestore document for each post will lead to errors if the combined size of the post data and image(s) exceeds this limit.  This results in a failure to write the document to Firestore, often manifesting as an error message indicating a document size exceeding the limit or a general write failure.\n\n## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step Code\n\nThis solution uses Cloud Storage for images and stores only references to the images in Firestore.\n\n**Step 1: Upload Images to Cloud Storage**\n\nFirst, we'll use the Firebase Admin SDK to upload images to Cloud Storage.  This code assumes you already have a Firebase project set up and the necessary credentials configured.\n\n```javascript\nconst { initializeApp } = require('firebase/app');\nconst { getStorage, ref, uploadBytesResumable, getDownloadURL } = require('firebase/storage');\n\n// Your Firebase configuration\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  // ... your firebase config ...\n};\n\nconst app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\nconst storage = getStorage(app);\n\nasync function uploadImage(file, postID) {\n  const storageRef = ref(storage, `posts/${postID}/${file.name}`);\n  const uploadTask = uploadBytesResumable(storageRef, file);\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    uploadTask.on('state_changed',\n      (snapshot) => {\n        // Observe state change events such as progress, pause, and resume\n        // Get task progress, including the number of bytes uploaded and the total number of bytes to be uploaded\n        const progress = (snapshot.bytesTransferred / snapshot.totalBytes) * 100;\n        console.log('Upload is ' + progress + '% done');\n        switch (snapshot.state) {\n          case 'paused':\n            console.log('Upload is paused');\n            break;\n          case 'running':\n            console.log('Upload is running');\n            break;\n        }\n      },\n      (error) => {\n        // Handle unsuccessful uploads\n        reject(error);\n      },\n      () => {\n        // Handle successful uploads on complete\n        getDownloadURL(uploadTask.snapshot.ref).then((downloadURL) => {\n          resolve(downloadURL);\n        });\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n\n//Example Usage\nconst file = /* your image file */; //replace with actual file\nconst postID = 'yourPostID'; // replace with your post ID\n\nuploadImage(file, postID).then((downloadURL) => {\n  console.log('File available at', downloadURL);\n  //Store downloadURL in Firestore\n}).catch((error) => {\n    console.error('Upload failed:', error);\n});\n\n```\n\n\n**Step 2: Store Image URLs in Firestore**\n\nAfter uploading, store only the Cloud Storage URLs in your Firestore documents. This keeps document sizes small.\n\n```javascript\nimport { getFirestore, doc, setDoc } from \"firebase/firestore\";\nconst db = getFirestore(app);\n\nasync function createPost(postID, text, imageUrl) {\n    try {\n        await setDoc(doc(db, \"posts\", postID), {\n            text: text,\n            imageUrl: imageUrl,\n            // ... other post data\n        });\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"Error adding document: \", error);\n    }\n}\n\n\n//Example Usage:\nconst postID = 'yourPostID';\nconst text = \"This is your post\";\nconst imageUrl = 'yourImageURL';\n\ncreatePost(postID, text, imageUrl);\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThis approach leverages Cloud Storage's scalability to handle large files.  Firestore is best suited for structured data and metadata, not large binary files. By separating image storage from your post data in Firestore, you avoid exceeding document size limits.  The application fetches the images from Cloud Storage only when needed for display, optimizing performance and storage costs.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Firestore Data Types and Limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas)\n* [Firebase Storage Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)\n* [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
