# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


**Description of the Error:**

A common issue in MongoDB arises when you create excessive indexes on your collections. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an overabundance can lead to performance degradation. This happens because each index consumes storage space and requires extra processing time during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  Write operations become slower as more indexes need to be updated.  Furthermore, excessive indexes can negatively impact query performance if the query optimizer struggles to choose the most efficient index. You might see slower write performance and unexpected query plan choices leading to suboptimal query speeds.


**Code and Fixing Steps:**

Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with the following schema:

```json
{
  "product_name": String,
  "category": String,
  "price": Number,
  "description": String,
  "tags": [String]
}
```

And we've inadvertently created numerous indexes, some redundant or inefficient:

```javascript
// Example of excessive indexes (Illustrative, not a recommended practice)
db.products.createIndex( { product_name: 1 } );
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } );
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } );
db.products.createIndex( { product_name: 1, category: 1 } );
db.products.createIndex( { product_name: 1, price: -1 } );
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } );
db.products.createIndex( { description: "text" } ); //text index
db.products.createIndex( { tags: 1 } ); // Array index
// ...more indexes...
```

**Step 1: Identify Redundant Indexes:**

Use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all existing indexes. Analyze them to identify any redundancy.  For example, if you have indexes on `product_name` and `category` individually and also a compound index on `product_name: 1, category: 1`, the individual indexes might be redundant.


**Step 2:  Analyze Index Usage:**

Utilize the MongoDB profiler to monitor query performance and identify which indexes are frequently used and which are rarely or never utilized. This will help prioritize indexes to keep and remove those rarely or never used.  You can enable the profiler via the shell or configuration file.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

After identifying redundant or underutilized indexes, remove them using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command.  For example, to remove the index on `price`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1 } );
```

To drop a compound index:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { product_name: 1, category: 1 } );
```

To drop a text index:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( "description_text" ); //Note the index name, not the field
```


**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes:**

Review the remaining indexes. Consider using compound indexes to optimize queries involving multiple fields.  If you are using array or embedded document data, ensure that your indexes support efficient queries in these structures.  Carefully consider the order of fields in a compound index as this impacts efficiency.



**Explanation:**

Over-indexing leads to slower write performance because every write operation needs to update all indexes.  Read performance can also degrade if the query optimizer gets overwhelmed by too many choices or chooses inefficient indexes.  By carefully choosing indexes based on query patterns and removing redundant or unused ones, you can improve both read and write performance.  The profiler is crucial to gathering data to help with this process.
