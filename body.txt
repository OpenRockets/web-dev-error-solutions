## Description of the Error

The "too many connections" error in MongoDB arises when your application attempts to establish more connections to the MongoDB server than allowed by the server's configuration. This typically occurs in high-traffic applications or when connections aren't properly closed after use.  The error message might vary slightly depending on your driver, but it generally indicates that the connection limit has been exceeded. This prevents new connections from being established, leading to application failures and impacting user experience.

## Fixing the Error: Step-by-Step Guide

This example demonstrates fixing the error using the Python MongoDB driver (PyMongo).  Adapt the code and concepts to your specific driver and environment.

**Step 1: Identify the Connection Limit**

First, determine the current connection limit on your MongoDB server. You can check this using the `mongostat` command-line utility (if installed) or through the MongoDB Compass GUI.  The relevant setting is typically `connections`.

**Step 2: Increase the Connection Limit (If Necessary)**

If the connection limit is too low for your application's needs, you can increase it.  **This is generally not the preferred solution and should only be considered as a temporary workaround.**  The preferred solution is to address the root cause of the excessive connection attempts.  To increase the limit, modify your MongoDB configuration file (`mongod.conf`) and restart the server.  You'll need to add or modify the following line (the exact syntax might vary slightly depending on your MongoDB version):

```
net:
  maxIncomingConnections: 1000  // Increase this value as needed
```

**Step 3: Implement Proper Connection Management in Your Code**

This is the **most important step**. The root of the problem usually lies in your application code failing to close connections properly.  Ensure that for every connection you open, you have a corresponding `close()` operation.  Here's an example using PyMongo:

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")  # Replace with your connection string

try:
    db = client["mydatabase"]
    collection = db["mycollection"]

    # Perform your database operations here...
    result = collection.find_one({"key": "value"})
    print(result)

except pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure as e:
    print(f"Could not connect to MongoDB: {e}")

finally:
    client.close() #Crucial step to close the connection

```

**Step 4: Use Connection Pooling**

Connection pooling is a technique that reuses existing connections instead of creating new ones each time. This significantly reduces the load on the MongoDB server and minimizes the risk of exceeding the connection limit.  PyMongo handles connection pooling automatically, but you might need to configure certain parameters (like `maxPoolSize`) depending on your needs.  Consult the PyMongo documentation for details.

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/", maxPoolSize=50) #Example of setting maxPoolSize

#rest of code remains the same

```


## Explanation

The "too many connections" error indicates that your application is not managing its database connections effectively. Each connection consumes server resources.  Without proper closure, these connections remain open, eventually exhausting the available resources.  Increasing the connection limit simply postpones the problem; it doesn't solve the underlying issue of inefficient connection management.  Connection pooling and meticulously closing connections are crucial for building robust and scalable MongoDB applications.
