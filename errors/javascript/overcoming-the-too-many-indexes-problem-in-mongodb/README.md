# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

One common problem MongoDB developers encounter is the creation of too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This happens because each index needs to be updated every time a document is written to the collection.  With numerous indexes, write operations become significantly slower, potentially impacting overall application performance.  This isn't necessarily an error message itself, but rather a performance bottleneck that manifests as slow write times and potentially high CPU usage on your MongoDB server.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection called `products`.  We'll assume you already have a MongoDB instance running and are using the MongoDB shell.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, we need to list all the indexes currently present on the `products` collection.  We'll use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command:

```javascript
use mydatabase  // Replace 'mydatabase' with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array of all indexes, including their name, keys, and other metadata. Examine this output carefully.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

The most crucial step is analyzing *which* indexes are actually being used. MongoDB provides profiling tools to help with this.  Enable profiling (if not already enabled) with the following command:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2)
```

This will log all queries and their execution times.  Run some typical queries against your `products` collection.  Then, disable profiling to avoid excessive logging:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```

Now, query the `system.profile` collection to review the executed queries and their associated index usage:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({ "ns": "mydatabase.products" })
```

Analyze the results to identify indexes that are rarely or never used.


**Step 3: Drop Unused Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes that are not contributing to query performance, you can remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to remove (obtained from Step 1):


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For example, if you have an index named `_id_`, you *should not* drop this index as it is crucial for document identification.  However, if you found an index called `product_description_text`, and it's unused, you would run:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("product_description_text")
```

Repeat this process for all unused indexes.


**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor your write performance. You can use MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's performance metrics to track the improvement.  Look at write latency, CPU utilization, and overall system throughput.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes leads to performance degradation due to the increased overhead during write operations. Every write operation necessitates updating all indexes.  The more indexes, the more updates, which slows down write speed.  The analysis of index usage allows you to identify and remove indexes that are not providing any performance benefits, thereby enhancing write performance without sacrificing read performance for the queries that actually require those indexes.
