This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing, card-like element that gives the illusion of depth using only CSS. We'll leverage CSS box-shadow and transform properties to achieve a 3D effect without any JavaScript. This example uses plain CSS3; a Tailwind CSS version would require similar techniques but with Tailwind's utility classes.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners. The 3D effect is created primarily through strategically placed box-shadows to simulate light and shadow, giving the impression of depth and a raised surface.  We'll also use `transform: rotateX()` to subtly tilt the card, enhancing the 3D illusion.  Finally, we'll add a gradient background for a more polished look.

**Full Code (CSS3):**

```css
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #4CAF50, #8BC34A); /* Gradient background */
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), /* Main shadow */
              -5px -5px 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); /* Inner shadow for lift */
  transform: rotateX(2deg); /* Subtle tilt for 3D effect */
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing */
  padding: 20px; /* Add padding for content */
  color: white; /* Text color for better contrast */
}

.card h2 {
  margin-top: 0; /* Remove default margin */
}

```

**Full Code (Illustrative Tailwind CSS - requires a Tailwind setup):**

```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-500 to-green-700 rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-green-500/50 -rotate-2 p-4">
  <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold">My 3D Card</h2>
  <p class="text-white mt-2">This is some sample text inside the card.</p>
</div>
```

*(Note: The Tailwind example uses pre-defined classes.  You'll need to adjust the classes depending on your specific Tailwind configuration and desired styling.)*

**Explanation:**

* **`width`, `height`, `border-radius`:** These set the basic dimensions and shape of the card.
* **`background`:**  This creates a gradient background for visual appeal.  You can change the colors to suit your needs.
* **`box-shadow`:** This is the core of the 3D effect. The first `box-shadow` creates the main shadow, giving the card depth. The second `box-shadow` with negative offsets creates a subtle inner shadow, making the card appear raised. Experiment with the values to fine-tune the effect.
* **`transform: rotateX(2deg)`:** This slightly rotates the card along the X-axis, adding to the 3D illusion. Adjust the angle for a stronger or weaker effect.
* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents any content within the card from overflowing its boundaries.
