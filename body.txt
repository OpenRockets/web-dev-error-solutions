## Description of the Error

A common performance problem in MongoDB arises from having too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can hinder performance due to:

* **Increased write times:** Every write operation must update all applicable indexes, slowing down insertion and update processes.  As the number of indexes grows, so does the write overhead.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes consume disk space.  Too many indexes can lead to significant storage costs and potentially impact read performance due to increased I/O operations.
* **Query planner confusion:** The query optimizer might struggle to select the optimal index when faced with numerous options, potentially leading to suboptimal query execution plans.  This results in slower query times.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address excessive indexes on a collection named `products` within a MongoDB database.

**Step 1: Identify Over-Indexed Collections**

Use the `db.collection.stats()` command to view collection statistics, including the number of indexes.  Collections with a disproportionately high number of indexes compared to the document count are candidates for optimization.

```javascript
use myDatabase; // Replace 'myDatabase' with your database name
db.products.stats()
```

This will output a JSON object with various statistics. Pay close attention to the `indexes` field, which gives the number of indexes.  Compare this number to the `count` field (total number of documents).  A high `indexes`/`count` ratio suggests potential over-indexing.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection.  Review each index's usage.  Indexes that aren't frequently used are candidates for removal.  There are tools and monitoring systems that may provide more detailed index usage statistics to help guide decision-making here.

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command will list all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  You would need to use monitoring tools or logs to evaluate usage.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified underutilized indexes, use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove them.  **Always back up your data before performing this step.**

Let's assume you identified an index named `index_on_description` as unnecessary.  You would remove it like this:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("index_on_description")
```

To remove an index defined by a specific key pattern:
```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } )
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance using tools provided by your MongoDB monitoring and logging setup.  Observe write and query speeds to see if the changes improved performance.


## Explanation

Indexes in MongoDB work similarly to indexes in relational databases. They speed up queries by creating a sorted structure based on specific fields. However, creating too many indexes creates overhead, outweighing the benefits.  Removing unused or underutilized indexes reduces this overhead, thereby leading to improved write and potentially read performance. The key is to find a balance: enough indexes to optimize frequently used queries but not so many that they hinder performance.
