## Description of the Error

The "Too Many Indexes" error, while not a specific MongoDB error message, describes a situation where a collection has an excessive number of indexes. This doesn't directly trigger an error during query execution but significantly impacts performance.  The problem arises because MongoDB needs to maintain and update all indexes during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  With too many indexes, these operations become slower, impacting write performance and potentially leading to significant application slowdown.  Furthermore, excessive indexes consume significant disk space.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary compound indexes. Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with several compound indexes that are no longer needed or are redundant.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

First, we need to identify the existing indexes using the `db.products.getIndexes()` command in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  Examine the output carefully, looking for indexes that:

* **Are redundant:**  If multiple indexes cover similar query patterns, one might be redundant.
* **Are unused:** If an index hasn't been used in a significant period, it's likely unnecessary.  MongoDB profiling can help identify unused indexes (see external references below).
* **Are too broad:** Compound indexes with many fields might be too broad and not selective enough to provide significant performance improvements.


**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes (Example)**

Let's say after analysis, we identify the following index as redundant:

```javascript
{
  "v" : 2,
  "key" : {
    "category" : 1,
    "price" : 1,
    "stock" : 1
  },
  "name" : "category_price_stock_1",
  "ns" : "your_database_name.products"
}
```


We can remove it using the `db.products.dropIndex()` command:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("category_price_stock_1")
```


Replace `"category_price_stock_1"` with the name of the index you want to remove.  If you are unsure of the index name, you can use the key as an argument:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1, price: 1, stock: 1 } )
```

Repeat this step for each unnecessary index identified in Step 1.

**Step 3: Verify the Removal and Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, verify their removal using `db.products.getIndexes()`.  Then, monitor application performance metrics (query response times, write operation throughput, disk I/O) to ensure the changes have a positive impact.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes can negatively impact performance due to the overhead associated with maintaining and updating them with every write operation.  Each index consumes storage space, and too many indexes can lead to increased disk I/O. This overhead can outweigh the benefits of faster query lookups, particularly in situations with high write volumes and less frequently used query patterns.
