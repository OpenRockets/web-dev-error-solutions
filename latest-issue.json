[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a modern-looking card using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature a gradient background, rounded corners, a subtle shadow, and styled text content.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes to achieve this efficiently.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will be rectangular with soft rounded corners.  It will have a background gradient transitioning between two shades of blue.  A subtle box shadow will provide depth. The card's content will include a title, a short description, and a button.  The text will be styled for readability and visual appeal, using Tailwind's typography utilities.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Modern Card</title>\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-700 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2\">Modern Card Design</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-white text-base mb-4\">This is a sample card created using Tailwind CSS.
