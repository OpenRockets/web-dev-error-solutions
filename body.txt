## Description of the Error

A common issue in MongoDB is having too many indexes on a collection. While indexes are crucial for query performance, an excessive number can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage space consumption.  The problem manifests as slow `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations, alongside increased storage costs.  MongoDB's write operations must update all relevant indexes, so the overhead becomes substantial with a large index count.  This can even lead to exceeding server resource limits and application instability.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection called "products" within a database named "eCommerce".  We will use the MongoDB shell for demonstration.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, we list all the indexes currently on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use eCommerce;
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This command will return a JSON array containing details of each index, including their keys and other metadata. Examine the output carefully to understand which indexes exist and their purpose.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

To understand which indexes are most beneficial and which are underutilized, we can leverage the MongoDB profiler. This requires enabling profiling (if not already enabled) and then running some representative queries against the `products` collection.  After running queries, we can examine the profiling logs.

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enable profiling level 2 (all operations)

// ... Run your typical queries against the "products" collection ...

db.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:10}}).sort({millis:-1}).limit(10); // Show top 10 slowest queries

db.setProfilingLevel(0); // Disable profiling
```


**Step 3: Identify and Remove Unused Indexes**

Based on the index list and profiling results, identify indexes that are not frequently used or are redundant. Let's say we identify an index on a field `lastUpdated` that is rarely used in queries.  We can remove this index as follows:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { lastUpdated: 1 } );
```

This command removes the index on the `lastUpdated` field in ascending order (indicated by `1`).  If the index is on `lastUpdated` in descending order, the command would be `db.products.dropIndex( { lastUpdated: -1 } )`.


**Step 4: Verify Changes**

After removing the index, use `db.products.getIndexes()` again to confirm that the unwanted index has been removed.  Monitor application performance to verify that write operations have improved.  You might also re-run your typical queries to ensure that performance has not been negatively impacted.  Consider using the MongoDB Compass GUI for more visual analysis of index usage and query performance.


## Explanation

The key to solving "too many indexes" is careful planning and regular review.  Before creating indexes, consider what queries are most frequent and crucial. Aim for a minimal set of indexes that efficiently support those critical queries. Regularly analyzing index usage via profiling helps identify redundant or underutilized indexes that should be removed.  The overhead of maintaining unnecessary indexes outweighs any potential performance gains.  Remember to consider compound indexes, which can often efficiently address multiple query patterns with a single index.
