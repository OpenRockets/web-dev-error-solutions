This challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card that gives the illusion of depth using only CSS and the Tailwind CSS framework.  We'll achieve this using box-shadows, transforms, and subtle gradients.  The card will feature a title, a brief description, and an image.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, modern design with a subtle 3D effect.  The key elements are:

* **Elevated appearance:** Achieved using a carefully crafted box-shadow.
* **Rounded corners:**  For a softer look and feel.
* **Gradient background:** Adding a touch of visual interest.
* **Image overlay:** A subtle semi-transparent overlay on the image to improve contrast.
* **Responsive design:**  The card should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

**Full Code (Tailwind CSS):**

```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-500 to-purple-500 rounded-lg shadow-xl p-6 w-80 max-w-sm mx-auto my-12">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Card Image" class="rounded-lg mb-4 shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-white text-lg">This is a sample description for the card.  It can be expanded to include more details as needed.  The use of Tailwind CSS makes styling quick and easy.</p>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

* `bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-500 to-purple-500`: This sets a background gradient transitioning from indigo to purple, going from bottom-right to top-left. You can customize these colors to your preference.
* `rounded-lg`: This adds large rounded corners to the card.
* `shadow-xl`: This applies a large box-shadow, creating the 3D effect.  You can adjust the shadow intensity using other shadow classes (e.g., `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`).
* `p-6`: This adds 6 units of padding all around the card's content.
* `w-80 max-w-sm`: This sets a width of 80 units and a maximum width of small. This ensures the card remains appropriately sized on different screens.
* `mx-auto`: This centers the card horizontally.
* `my-12`: This adds 12 units of margin top and bottom, providing spacing around the card.
* `rounded-lg mb-4 shadow-md` (on the image): Applies rounded corners, bottom margin, and a smaller shadow to the image.
* The heading (`h2`) and paragraph (`p`) use Tailwind classes for styling text.
