# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common issue in MongoDB, particularly in larger applications, is having "too many indexes". While indexes significantly speed up queries, excessive indexing can lead to several performance problems:

* **Write Slowdowns:**  Creating too many indexes increases the overhead during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes). Every write operation needs to update all relevant indexes, slowing down data insertion and modification.
* **Storage Consumption:**  Indexes consume significant disk space.  Many indexes translate to a substantial increase in storage costs and potentially slower read performance due to increased I/O operations.
* **Query Planner Confusion:**  The query planner might struggle to choose the optimal index for a given query when presented with an overwhelming number of options, leading to suboptimal query execution plans.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address the problem by analyzing index usage and removing redundant or underperforming indexes.

**Step 1: Identifying Unused or Underperforming Indexes:**

We'll use the `db.collection.stats()` and `db.collection.getIndexes()` commands along with query profiling to identify problematic indexes.

```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB database (replace with your connection string)
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.8.0"; // Replace with your connection string
const client = new MongoClient(uri);

async function analyzeIndexes(dbName, collectionName){
    try {
      await client.connect();
      const db = client.db(dbName);
      const collection = db.collection(collectionName);
  
      // Get collection statistics
      const stats = await collection.stats();
      console.log("Collection Statistics:", stats);
  
      // Get indexes
      const indexes = await collection.getIndexes();
      console.log("\nIndexes:", indexes);
  
      //Example of query profiling (adjust for your specific queries)
      await db.command({ profile: 1 }); // Turn on profiling
      const result = await collection.find({}).toArray(); // Execute a sample query
      const profile = await db.collection('system.profile').find().sort({$natural:-1}).limit(1).toArray(); // get the last profile entry.
      await db.command({ profile: 0 }); // Turn off profiling
      console.log("\nQuery Profile:", profile);

    } finally {
      await client.close();
    }
}

//Replace with your database and collection name
analyzeIndexes("yourDatabaseName", "yourCollectionName");
```

**Step 2: Removing Redundant Indexes:**

After analyzing, if you find indexes with similar selectivity or covering the same query patterns, remove the less efficient one. For example, if you have indexes on `{fieldA: 1}` and `{fieldA: 1, fieldB: 1}`, the second index is likely redundant unless there are many queries utilizing both fields.

```javascript
//Remove index using name from getIndexes() output
db.collection.dropIndex("indexName");

//Example to remove index by keys
db.collection.dropIndex({fieldA: 1});
```

**Step 3:  Monitoring and Iteration:**

Continuously monitor index usage using `db.collection.stats()` and profiling to further refine your indexing strategy.  It's an iterative process.  Remove one index at a time, observing performance changes, before removing additional indexes.


## Explanation

The root cause of "too many indexes" is often a lack of careful planning and insufficient monitoring.  Developers might add indexes reactively to improve individual queries, neglecting the cumulative effect on write performance and storage.  Query profiling helps pinpoint queries that are not benefiting from indexes, indicating potential candidates for removal. By using the techniques described above, you can reduce storage costs, increase write performance, and create a healthier database.
