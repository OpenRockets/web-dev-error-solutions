# üêû Overusing Indexes in MongoDB: Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can actually lead to significant performance degradation.  This occurs because writing to a collection becomes slower as MongoDB must update all relevant indexes every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  Excessive indexing increases storage overhead and can severely impact write operations, outweighing the benefits of faster reads.  This is especially problematic with high-volume write operations. The symptoms often include slow write operations, increased disk I/O, and ultimately, a degraded application performance.

## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Examples)

This example demonstrates identifying and addressing over-indexing in a MongoDB collection using the MongoDB Compass GUI and the `db.collection.stats()` command.  Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with several indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Over-Indexed Collections**

We first need to identify collections with excessive indexes. The `db.collection.stats()` command provides details about collection statistics, including index information.  You can run this command directly in the MongoDB shell (e.g., mongo shell):

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```

This command will output a JSON object containing various statistics, including the number of indexes.  Pay attention to the `indexSizes` and the `avgObjSize`. A large `indexSizes` relative to the data size might indicate over-indexing.  The output might look like this (simplified):

```json
{
  "ns" : "mydb.products",
  "count" : 10000,
  "size" : 10485760, // Data size
  "avgObjSize" : 1048.576,
  "storageSize" : 20971520, // Total storage size (includes indexes)
  "numExtents" : 1,
  "nindexes" : 5, // Number of indexes
  "indexSizes" : { 
    "index1": 1024000,
    "index2": 1024000,
    "index3": 1024000,
    "index4": 1024000,
    "index5": 1024000
  },
  // ... other statistics
}
```

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage (MongoDB Compass)**

MongoDB Compass provides a visual representation of index usage. Connect to your database in Compass, select the `products` collection, and navigate to the "Indexes" tab.  Review the usage statistics for each index.  Indexes with low usage can be candidates for removal.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified underutilized indexes, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual index name from `db.products.getIndexes()`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For example, to drop an index named `category_1`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("category_1_1")
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor write performance.  You can use MongoDB's monitoring tools or application performance monitoring (APM) to track write latency and throughput.


## Explanation

Over-indexing creates unnecessary overhead during write operations. Every index needs to be updated whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This additional work significantly slows down write operations, especially in high-volume environments.  Identifying and removing unused or less frequently used indexes can significantly improve write performance and reduce storage space consumption.  The optimal number of indexes depends on the specific workload and query patterns.  Careful analysis and regular review of index usage are crucial to maintain optimal database performance.
