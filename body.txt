This challenge involves creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using only Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve the 3D illusion through clever use of shadows, subtle transformations, and color gradients.  No JavaScript is required.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, modern look with a slightly elevated appearance.  This is achieved primarily through a combination of box-shadow and subtle transforms. We'll use a light gradient to add depth and a contrasting background color for the content area.


**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="relative w-64 bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-200 to-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-lg shadow-gray-400/50 overflow-hidden transform translate-z-1">
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-inner shadow-gray-100/50"></div>

  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400" alt="Card Image" class="w-full h-48 object-cover">

  <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded-b-lg">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">This is a sample card with a 3D-like effect.  It uses only Tailwind CSS for styling.
    </p>
    <button class="mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">Learn More</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`relative`**: This makes the card the positioning context for absolutely positioned children.
* **`w-64`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-gray-400/50`**: These Tailwind classes set the width, rounded corners, box shadow, and shadow color respectively.  The `/50` adds opacity to the shadow.
* **`bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-200 to-gray-100`**: This creates a gradient background from light gray to a slightly darker gray.
* **`overflow-hidden`**: This prevents content from overflowing the card's boundaries.
* **`transform translate-z-1`**: This adds a subtle "lift" to the card, enhancing the 3D effect.
* **`absolute inset-0`**: This makes the inner white background element take up the entire space of the parent card.
* **`shadow-inner shadow-gray-100/50`**: This inner shadow adds to the depth effect.
* **`object-cover`**:  This ensures the image covers the entire container.
