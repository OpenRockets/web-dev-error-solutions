This challenge involves creating a card that expands smoothly when hovered over, revealing more content. We'll use Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, making the styling concise and efficient.  The animation will be handled using CSS transitions.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, modern design.  When the user hovers over the card, it smoothly expands horizontally to reveal additional text that is initially hidden. The expansion will be accompanied by a subtle background color change. The card will use a neutral color palette for a professional feel.

**Explanation:**

* **Tailwind Classes:**  The code uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  For example, `max-w-sm` sets a maximum width, `rounded` rounds the corners, `shadow-lg` adds a shadow, and `bg-gray-100` sets the background color. The `transition` and `duration` classes handle the smooth animation.  The `hover:` prefix modifies the styles on hover.
* **Hidden Content:** The extra content is initially hidden using the `hidden` class.  On hover, the `hover:block` class makes it visible.
* **Placeholder Image:** A placeholder image is used. You should replace `"https://via.placeholder.com/400x200"` with your own image URL.
* **Responsiveness:** Tailwind CSS provides responsive design capabilities; you can adjust the styles for different screen sizes easily.
