## Description of the Problem

A common challenge when using Firebase Firestore for storing blog posts or similar content is managing large amounts of data efficiently.  Storing entire posts (including potentially large images, videos, or extensive text) directly within a single Firestore document can lead to several issues:

* **Document Size Limits:** Firestore has document size limits (currently 1 MB). Exceeding this limit results in errors when attempting to write or update the document.
* **Slow Read/Write Operations:** Retrieving and updating large documents is significantly slower than working with smaller, more focused documents. This impacts application performance, especially on mobile devices.
* **Inefficient Data Retrieval:** Often, you only need a subset of the post's data (e.g., title, summary, and thumbnail for a post list). Retrieving the entire document to display a small portion is wasteful and slow.

## Step-by-Step Solution: Using Storage and Subcollections

The optimal approach involves separating large media files (images, videos) to Firebase Storage and storing only references (URLs) to them in Firestore.  Furthermore, we can utilize subcollections to organize related data efficiently.

**Code (JavaScript):**

```javascript
// 1. Install necessary packages (if not already installed)
// npm install firebase @firebase/storage

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore, collection, addDoc, doc, getDoc, updateDoc } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytesResumable, getDownloadURL } from "firebase/storage";

// Your Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // ... your config ...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);
const storage = getStorage(app);

// 2. Function to upload an image to Firebase Storage and return the download URL
async function uploadImage(image, postID) {
  const storageRef = ref(storage, `posts/${postID}/image.jpg`); // or use a unique filename
  const uploadTask = uploadBytesResumable(storageRef, image);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    uploadTask.on('state_changed', 
      (snapshot) => {
        // Observe state change events such as progress, pause, and resume
        // Get task progress, including the number of bytes uploaded and the total number of bytes to be uploaded
        const progress = (snapshot.bytesTransferred / snapshot.totalBytes) * 100;
        console.log('Upload is ' + progress + '% done');
        switch (snapshot.state) {
          case 'paused':
            console.log('Upload is paused');
            break;
          case 'running':
            console.log('Upload is running');
            break;
        }
      }, 
      (error) => {
        // Handle unsuccessful uploads
        reject(error);
      }, 
      () => {
        // Handle successful uploads on complete
        getDownloadURL(uploadTask.snapshot.ref).then((downloadURL) => {
          resolve(downloadURL);
        });
      }
    );
  });
}


// 3. Function to create a new post
async function createPost(title, content, image) {
  try {
    const imageURL = await uploadImage(image, Date.now()); // Upload image and get URL

    const postRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "posts"), {
      title: title,
      content: content, // Consider limiting content length if necessary
      imageUrl: imageURL,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    });

    console.log("Post created with ID: ", postRef.id);
    // Optionally, you could add a comments subcollection here:
    // const commentsCollectionRef = collection(postRef, 'comments');
    return postRef.id;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating post:", error);
  }
}

// 4. Function to retrieve a post
async function getPost(postId) {
    const docRef = doc(db, "posts", postId);
    const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);

    if (docSnap.exists()) {
        return docSnap.data();
    } else {
        console.log("No such document!");
        return null;
    }
}

//Example Usage
createPost("My Awesome Post", "This is the content...", imageFile)
    .then((postId) => {
        // Do something with the postId like displaying it on the page.
        console.log("Post ID:", postId);
    });

getPost("yourPostId").then((post) => {
    console.log("Post data:", post);
});

```

## Explanation

This solution addresses the problem by:

1. **Offloading Large Files:** Images and videos are stored in Firebase Storage, a service optimized for storing and serving binary data.  This keeps Firestore documents smaller and improves performance.
2. **Using References:**  Firestore only stores URLs pointing to the files in Storage, significantly reducing document size.
3. **Structured Data:** The code demonstrates how to upload an image and obtain its URL.  This URL is then stored in Firestore along with other post metadata (title, content, etc.).
