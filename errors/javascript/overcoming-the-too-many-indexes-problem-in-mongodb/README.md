# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB stemming from an excessive number of indexes.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, having too many can severely impact write performance and storage space. This problem transcends specific CRUD operations, data types, or even specific collection designs, manifesting across various aspects of MongoDB usage (Databases, Collections, CRUD operations).

## Description of the Error

The primary symptom of having too many indexes is a noticeable slowdown in write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This occurs because every write operation necessitates updating all relevant indexes.  A secondary symptom can be increased storage space consumption, as each index requires its own storage overhead.  MongoDB's logging might not explicitly state "too many indexes," but performance monitoring will reveal slower write speeds and potentially larger storage usage than expected.  The MongoDB profiler can highlight index-related slowdowns.


## Step-by-Step Fix

This fix involves identifying and removing unnecessary indexes. The process is iterative and requires careful analysis of your application's query patterns.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

Use the MongoDB shell to list all indexes on a specific collection:

```javascript
db.collectionName.getIndexes()
```

Replace `collectionName` with the actual name of your collection.  This command returns a list of indexes, including their name and keys.


**Step 2: Analyze Query Patterns**

Examine your application's code and identify the queries most frequently executed.  Focus on queries with `$query` or equivalent operators to see what fields are used.  Tools like the MongoDB Profiler are invaluable here.  Analyze the `explain()` output of your queries to understand which indexes are used, or if none are used (which indicates a potential index optimization need). Example:

```javascript
db.collectionName.find({ field1: "value1", field2: "value2" }).explain()
```

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes that aren't frequently used or are redundant (e.g., covering the same query patterns), remove them using the `db.collectionName.dropIndex()` command:


```javascript
// Example: Removing an index named 'myIndex'
db.collectionName.dropIndex("myIndex")

// Example: Removing an index based on specific keys
db.collectionName.dropIndex({ field1: 1, field2: -1 })
```

Remember to replace `"myIndex"` and `{ field1: 1, field2: -1 }` with the actual index name or key specification you want to remove.



**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor write performance again.  Use MongoDB's monitoring tools or your application's logging to track improvements.

## Explanation

Having too many indexes leads to performance degradation due to the write overhead. Each write operation needs to update all relevant indexes, leading to increased I/O operations and potentially contention on locks.  Over time, many indexes contribute to significantly larger storage usage because each index is a full copy of data subset, indexed on specified fields.  Carefully selecting appropriate indexes based on the most frequent query patterns is key to optimizing both read and write operations.  A good strategy involves identifying the top 80% of queries by frequency and then creating indexes primarily targeted at these queries.
