## Description of the Problem

A common challenge when using Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve blog posts or similar content is managing large datasets efficiently.  Storing entire posts, especially those containing rich text, images, or videos, directly within a single Firestore document can lead to several issues:

* **Slow Queries:** Retrieving large documents impacts query performance, leading to slow loading times for users.
* **Data Redundancy:** If posts share common elements (e.g., author information), storing this information repeatedly within each post leads to data redundancy and increased storage costs.
* **Document Size Limits:** Firestore has document size limits. Exceeding these limits prevents data from being saved.

This problem stems from a lack of proper data normalization and efficient data structuring for large datasets.


## Step-by-Step Code Solution (Node.js with Admin SDK)

This solution demonstrates how to improve performance by denormalizing and storing data across multiple collections.  We'll separate the post's core information from its content.

**1. Data Structure:**

We'll create two collections: `posts` and `postContent`.

* **`posts` collection:** Contains metadata about each post:  `postId` (String, ID), `title` (String), `authorId` (String), `createdAt` (Timestamp), `summary` (String).

* **`postContent` collection:** Contains the full text and other rich content associated with each post.  `postId` (String, ID), `content` (String or JSON object for rich text).

**2. Code (Node.js with Admin SDK):**

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp();
const db = admin.firestore();

// Function to add a new post
async function addPost(title, authorId, content, summary) {
  const postId = db.collection('posts').doc().id;

  // Add post metadata to 'posts' collection
  await db.collection('posts').doc(postId).set({
    postId: postId,
    title: title,
    authorId: authorId,
    createdAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    summary: summary
  });

  // Add post content to 'postContent' collection
  await db.collection('postContent').doc(postId).set({
    postId: postId,
    content: content
  });

  console.log('Post added successfully with ID:', postId);
}


// Function to retrieve a post
async function getPost(postId) {
  const postDoc = await db.collection('posts').doc(postId).get();
  const contentDoc = await db.collection('postContent').doc(postId).get();

  if (!postDoc.exists || !contentDoc.exists) {
    return null;
  }

  const post = postDoc.data();
  post.content = contentDoc.data().content;
  return post;
}


// Example usage:
async function main() {
  const newPost = await addPost(
      "My Awesome Post",
      "user123",
      "This is the full content of my awesome post...",
      "A short summary of my post"
  );
  console.log(newPost)
  const retrievedPost = await getPost("your-post-id"); // Replace with actual postId
  console.log(retrievedPost);
}

main().catch(console.error);

```

**3. Querying:**

Querying becomes more efficient because queries on the `posts` collection only involve smaller documents.  You can use the `postId` to fetch the corresponding content from `postContent` as needed.  You can also efficiently filter and sort based on metadata in the `posts` collection.


## Explanation

This approach improves performance through:

* **Reduced Document Size:** The `posts` collection contains only essential metadata, resulting in smaller document sizes.
* **Optimized Queries:** Queries targeting the `posts` collection are faster due to smaller document sizes.
* **Data Normalization:**  Avoiding redundancy in storing author information (you would likely have a separate `users` collection).
* **Improved Scalability:** This structure scales better as the number of posts increases.
