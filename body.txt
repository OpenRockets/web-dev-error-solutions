This challenge involves creating a card element that visually resembles a 3D card using only Tailwind CSS.  The effect will be achieved through shadows, subtle transformations, and color gradients.  No actual 3D transforms (like `perspective` and `rotate`) will be used, maintaining compatibility across browsers.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will be a rectangular element with a slightly raised appearance.  This will be primarily achieved using box shadows.  A subtle gradient will be added to give it depth and a more polished look.  The text content within the card will be clearly visible and styled appropriately.

**Full Code:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-gray-500/50 relative overflow-hidden">
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100 to-indigo-100 opacity-20 blur-lg"></div>
  <div class="p-6">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Featured Card</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      This is a sample text for a featured card. You can customize this text to your liking.
    </p>
    <button class="mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">

```

**Explanation:**

* **`max-w-sm`**: Sets a maximum width for the card.
* **`bg-white`**: Sets the background color to white.
* **`rounded-lg`**: Adds rounded corners.
* **`shadow-2xl shadow-gray-500/50`**: Applies a large box shadow with a gray color and 50% opacity, creating the raised effect. The `/50` part controls the opacity of the shadow.
* **`relative`**: Makes the card a relative container for absolute positioning of the gradient.
* **`overflow-hidden`**: Prevents the gradient from overflowing the card boundaries.
* **`absolute inset-0`**: Positions the gradient element to cover the entire card.
* **`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100 to-indigo-100`**: Creates a gradient from light blue to light indigo going from top-left to bottom-right.
* **`opacity-20 blur-lg`**: Sets the opacity and blur for a subtle, soft gradient effect.
* **`p-6`**: Adds padding to the inner content.
* **`text-xl font-bold mb-2`**: Styles the card title.
* **`text-gray-700 text-base`**: Styles the card body text.
* **`mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`**: Styles the button.
