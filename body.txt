**Description of the Error:**

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead.  Adding too many indexes, especially compound indexes (indexes on multiple fields), increases the time required to write new documents and update existing ones. This is because every write operation needs to update all relevant indexes, making the database slower and potentially less efficient than having no indexes at all.  The increased storage usage can also lead to higher costs.  The problem often manifests as slow write operations and increased storage costs without a proportional improvement in read performance.


**Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Examples):**

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes using the MongoDB shell.  Assume we have a collection called `products` with several indexes:

**1. Identify Existing Indexes:**

```javascript
use mydatabase; // replace mydatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This will output a list of all indexes on the `products` collection, including their names, keys, and other properties.  Examine the output to identify indexes that are rarely or never used.  Look for indexes with low usage statistics (if your MongoDB version supports index usage monitoring).

**2. Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Let's say we identify an index `_id_1_name_1` as unused.  We remove it as follows:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("_id_1_name_1");
```

Replace `"_id_1_name_1"` with the actual name of the index you want to drop.  If you're unsure, you can also drop the index using the key specification:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({ name: 1 });
```

This will drop the index on the `name` field regardless of the index name.

**3. Monitoring Index Usage (if supported):**

Modern MongoDB versions offer monitoring tools and metrics for tracking index utilization.  These metrics will give you insights into which indexes are actually contributing to query optimization.  You can use the `db.adminCommand( {serverStatus: 1} )` command (part of MongoDB's serverStatus command) to examine index usage stats (if available).  The exact structure will vary according to your MongoDB version. This helps to understand the performance impact of each index.

**4.  Strategic Index Creation:**

Focus on creating indexes only for frequently used query patterns.  For example, if your application frequently queries for products based on their category and price, create a compound index on both fields:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } );
```

The `1` indicates ascending order; `-1` would indicate descending order.


**Explanation:**

Over-indexing increases write operations because MongoDB needs to update all indexes whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  It also consumes additional disk space.  Before creating an index, it's crucial to assess if it's genuinely necessary. The overhead of maintaining unnecessary indexes might outweigh their performance benefits, especially if write operations are a significant portion of your workload.  The best approach involves a careful balance: indexing frequently used query patterns while avoiding unnecessary indexes.  Continuous monitoring of index usage can help make informed decisions about index management.
