# üêû Overusing Indexes in MongoDB: Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up query performance by creating sorted structures for specific fields, excessive indexing can lead to significant performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because every write operation must update all relevant indexes, and too many indexes increase the overhead, potentially making writes slower than reads.  This can manifest as slow application performance, especially during periods of high write activity, and might not be immediately apparent during development with small datasets.

## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Example)

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with several indexes, some of which are underutilized:

**1. Identify Unused Indexes:**

The most effective way to identify underused indexes is by analyzing your query logs and profiling your application.  MongoDB's profiling capabilities can pinpoint the queries that are frequently executed and the indexes used (or not used). However, a basic starting point is to examine existing indexes and assess their necessity.

```bash
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command will return a list of all indexes on the `products` collection.  Carefully examine the fields included in each index.


**2. Removing an Unnecessary Index (Example):**

Suppose the following index is identified as redundant:

```javascript
{
	"v" : 2,
	"key" : {
		"description" : 1,
		"category" : 1
	},
	"name" : "description_1_category_1",
	"ns" : "mydatabase.products"
}
```

This index might be unnecessary if queries rarely filter by both `description` and `category` together. We can remove it using the following command:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("description_1_category_1")
```

**3. Re-evaluate Indexes Based on Query Patterns:**

After removing unnecessary indexes, re-evaluate your application's query patterns and ensure you have appropriate indexes for frequently used queries.  Focus on indexes that support the most common query filters. Aim for a balance ‚Äì enough indexes to speed up reads without significantly impacting writes.


**4. Monitoring Performance After Changes:**

After removing or adding indexes, monitor your application's performance using MongoDB monitoring tools (e.g., MongoDB Compass, Atlas monitoring) to verify the impact of your changes.


## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to write performance degradation because every write operation must update every relevant index.  The additional overhead of maintaining numerous indexes can outweigh the benefits of faster reads, especially in high-write environments.  Analyzing query patterns and using profiling tools are crucial to identifying indexes that are not providing a significant return on investment (ROI) in terms of performance improvement.  A good index strategy is about striking a balance between read and write performance.
