# 🐞 MongoDB: Overuse of `$where` in Queries Leading to Performance Issues


## Description of the Error

The `$where` operator in MongoDB allows you to specify JavaScript code for filtering documents. While powerful, it's notorious for causing significant performance bottlenecks, especially with large datasets.  This is because `$where` bypasses MongoDB's optimized query engine, forcing a full collection scan on the server-side for each document, interpreting JavaScript code for every single record.  This contrasts sharply with optimized queries that leverage indexes.  As a result, queries utilizing `$where` become increasingly slow as your data grows.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's consider a scenario where you're trying to find documents where a calculated field based on multiple fields meets a certain condition.  The incorrect approach using `$where`:

```javascript
// Incorrect use of $where
db.myCollection.find( { $where: "this.fieldA + this.fieldB > 100" } )
```

This query is inefficient.  The correct approach involves creating a compound index and structuring your query to leverage it:

**Step 1: Add a Compound Index**

Instead of calculating the sum within the query, we'll add a new field storing the pre-calculated sum and index it.  This allows MongoDB to efficiently filter based on the indexed field.  Here's how we do it using the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
// Add a new field calculating the sum
db.myCollection.updateMany( {}, [ { $set: { sumAB: { $add: [ "$fieldA", "$fieldB" ] } } } ] )


// Create a compound index on the new field
db.myCollection.createIndex( { sumAB: 1 } )
```

**Step 2: Modify your query**

Now we can rewrite the query to use the new indexed field:

```javascript
// Efficient query using the index
db.myCollection.find( { sumAB: { $gt: 100 } } )
```

This revised query utilizes the index, making it significantly faster than the original `$where` query.  If `fieldA` and `fieldB` are also relevant for other queries, a compound index including all three would be beneficial:

```javascript
db.myCollection.createIndex( { fieldA: 1, fieldB: 1, sumAB: 1 } )
```


## Explanation

The `$where` operator forces a full collection scan because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code for each document.  Indexes are data structures that allow MongoDB to quickly locate specific documents based on the values of one or more fields. By pre-calculating the sum and creating an index on it, we allow MongoDB to efficiently use the index to locate only the relevant documents, avoiding the costly full collection scan.  This results in dramatically improved query performance.  Choosing the right indexes is crucial for optimal MongoDB performance.
