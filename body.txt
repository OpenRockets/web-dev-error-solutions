## Description of the Error

A common issue in MongoDB development is creating too many indexes, leading to performance degradation instead of improvement.  While indexes speed up queries, excessive indexing increases the write overhead (inserts, updates, deletes) significantly because the indexes themselves need to be updated with every write operation. This can result in slower application performance, especially in high-write environments.  MongoDB's query optimizer may also struggle to choose the best index among many, leading to suboptimal query execution plans. The symptoms often include slow write operations, increased storage usage, and unexpectedly long query times.  You might also see warnings or errors in your MongoDB logs related to high index usage.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products` within a database called `mydatabase`.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

First, list all indexes on the `products` collection using the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
use mydatabase;
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  Analyze the output to determine which indexes are rarely or never used. Look for indexes with low usage statistics (if available -  consider using the MongoDB profiler for detailed statistics) or indexes that are redundant (e.g., covering the same fields with different orders).

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

After identifying redundant or unused indexes, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to drop (as shown in the output from `getIndexes()`):

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>");
```

For example, if you have an index named `_id_`, you should *not* drop it as it's the default primary key index, crucial for document identification. If you have an index named `{"category": 1, "price": -1}` which is not used, you would drop it using:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"category": 1, "price": -1});
```

You can also drop multiple indexes at once using the following command, replacing the names with your actual index names:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndexes(["<index_name_1>", "<index_name_2>"]);
```

**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance to ensure the changes have improved write speeds and overall application responsiveness. Use the MongoDB profiler or monitoring tools to track query performance and index usage.

## Explanation

The root cause is the overhead associated with maintaining numerous indexes. Each write operation requires updating all applicable indexes, and too many indexes exponentially increase this overhead.  The query optimizer might also spend more time evaluating the various indexes, delaying query execution.  The solution involves strategically identifying and removing indexes that are not significantly contributing to query performance, optimizing the balance between read and write speeds.  Regular review and optimization of indexes are crucial for maintaining optimal performance in MongoDB.
