# üêû CSS Challenge:  3D-ish Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a card element that gives the illusion of depth using only CSS and Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature a subtle shadow, a slightly raised appearance, and a gradient background for added visual appeal.  No JavaScript will be used.


## Description of the Styling

The card will be rectangular with rounded corners.  The "3D-ish" effect is achieved primarily through box-shadow and subtle transformations.  A linear gradient background will add depth and visual interest. We'll use Tailwind's utility classes for efficient styling.

## Explanation

* **`container mx-auto p-8`**: This centers the card horizontally on the page and adds padding.
* **`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-500`**: This applies a linear gradient background starting from blue and transitioning to purple.  The `to-br` specifies the direction of the gradient.
* **`rounded-lg`**: Rounds the corners of the card.
* **`shadow-2xl`**: Applies a large box shadow to simulate a raised effect.  Tailwind provides many pre-defined shadow styles.
* **`p-6`**: Adds padding inside the card.
* **`w-64`**: Sets a fixed width for the card (adjust as needed).
* The inner content uses standard Tailwind classes for text styling and button styling.
