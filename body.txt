This challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card element that mimics a three-dimensional appearance using only CSS.  We'll achieve this using box-shadow, transforms, and gradients.  No JavaScript is required.


## Description of the Styling

The goal is to create a card that looks like it's slightly elevated from the page, with a subtle shadow and a gradient to add depth.  The card will have a title and some descriptive text.  We'll use Tailwind CSS for easier and faster styling.

## Explanation

* **`bg-white`**: Sets the card background to white.
* **`shadow-lg`**: Applies a large shadow for the 3D effect.
* **`rounded-lg`**: Adds rounded corners.
* **`overflow-hidden`**: Prevents content from overflowing the card's boundaries.
* **`transform transition-transform hover:scale-105`**:  This adds a subtle hover effect, scaling up the card slightly on hover.  This adds to the interactive feel and reinforces the 3D effect.
* **`bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-blue-700`**: Creates a beautiful gradient at the bottom of the card.  You can customize the colors as needed.
* **Tailwind's Utility Classes**: Tailwind's utility-first approach makes styling incredibly concise and efficient.  Each class represents a single style.
