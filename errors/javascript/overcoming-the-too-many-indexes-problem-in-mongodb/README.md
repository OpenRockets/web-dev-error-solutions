# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB stems from having too many indexes.  While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can negatively impact write performance.  Every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, leading to slowdowns and increased resource consumption. This is particularly noticeable during high-write load scenarios.  The symptoms often include:

* **Slow write operations:**  Insertion, updates, and deletions take considerably longer than expected.
* **High CPU utilization:** The MongoDB process consumes a disproportionate amount of CPU resources.
* **Increased latency:** Queries may experience increased latency even if they utilize indexes effectively.
* **Errors related to index creation/maintenance:**  You might encounter errors related to index creation due to resource limitations.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes using the `mongosh` shell.  Let's assume we've identified that the `products` collection has too many indexes.

**Step 1: List all Indexes**

```javascript
use mydatabase; // Replace mydatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command displays all indexes currently defined on the `products` collection. Carefully examine each index, noting the fields and the usage frequency (if available from monitoring tools).

**Step 2: Identify Unused Indexes**

Determining which indexes are truly unused often requires analyzing your application's query patterns.  Tools like MongoDB Compass or profiling can be invaluable. If you have a query that is repeatedly slow without an appropriate index, that would also suggest the need for creating an index.  Identify indexes that:

* **Are not used in queries:**  If an index hasn't been used for a significant period, it's a candidate for removal.
* **Are redundant:** Multiple indexes covering similar fields may be unnecessary.  A compound index (e.g., `{ category: 1, price: -1 }`) often covers the use cases of indexes on `category` and `price` individually.
* **Are overly specific:**  Indexes with many fields might be too specific and rarely used.

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified unnecessary indexes, drop them using the following command. Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index (from the output of `getIndexes()`).

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For example, to drop an index named `category_1_price_1`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("category_1_price_1")
```

**Step 4: Verify Index Changes**

After dropping indexes, use `db.products.getIndexes()` again to verify that the unwanted indexes have been removed. Monitor write performance to ensure that the changes have improved write times and resource utilization.


## Explanation

The core reason behind this problem is a trade-off between read and write performance. Indexes optimize read operations by providing a quick lookup path, but they add overhead to write operations because the indexes must be updated with every insert, update, or delete.  Overly numerous indexes exacerbate this write overhead, making the database slower for the most common actions.  A well-structured indexing strategy balances the needs of both reads and writes.
