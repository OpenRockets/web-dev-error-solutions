[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a responsive product card using Tailwind CSS. The card should display a product image, title, description, price, and a \"Add to Cart\" button.  The layout should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe product card will utilize a clean and modern design.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for quick and efficient styling. The card will have a shadow, rounded corners, and padding. The image will be responsive and maintain aspect ratio. The text will be clearly legible and well-spaced.  The \"Add to Cart\" button will have a distinct style to encourage interaction.  Responsiveness is key; the layout should adjust elegantly on smaller screens, potentially stacking elements vertically.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Product Card</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n\n<div class=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n  <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden md:max-w-xl\">\n    <img class=\"w-full h-48 object-cover\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/600x400\" alt=\"Product Image\">\n    <div class=\"p-4\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\">Awesome Product Name</h2>\n      <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base mb-4\">This is a short description of the awesome product.

You should replace the placeholder image URL with your actual product image.\n* **Tailwind Typography Classes**:  `text-xl`, `font-bold`, `text-gray-700`, etc., are used for text styling.\n* **`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700`**: Styles the button with a blue background and changes it on hover.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)\n* **Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet:**  (Search for \"Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet\" on Google for various options)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
