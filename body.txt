## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB, especially in rapidly growing applications, is having too many indexes. While indexes dramatically improve query performance, an excessive number can lead to significant write performance degradation.  This is because every write operation (insert, update, delete) needs to update all relevant indexes, making the process slower and consuming more resources.  Symptoms include slow write operations, increased latency, and high CPU usage during write-heavy periods.  The MongoDB profiler might show slow `insert`, `update`, or `delete` operations with a significant time spent on index building.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing redundant or underutilized indexes. We will use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list existing indexes, analyze their usage, and then drop unnecessary ones.  Let's assume we're working with a collection called `products`.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, connect to your MongoDB instance and access the database containing the `products` collection.  Then, list all indexes using the following command:


```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes on the `products` collection, including their keys and other metadata.  Examine the output carefully.  Look for indexes that:


* **Are redundant:**  Multiple indexes covering similar fields might be redundant.
* **Are rarely used:** Analyze your query logs or use the MongoDB profiler to find indexes rarely used in queries.
* **Have very low selectivity:**  Indexes on fields with many duplicate values don't offer much performance gain.


**Step 2:  Analyze Index Usage (Optional but Recommended)**

For a more data-driven approach, use the MongoDB profiler to monitor query performance and index usage.  Enable profiling and run your application for a while to collect data. Then analyze the profiles to pinpoint underperforming indexes. More details on using the profiler can be found in the MongoDB documentation (see External References).


**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes to remove, use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command. Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to drop.


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>") 
// Example:  db.products.dropIndex("my_redundant_index")
// Example: db.products.dropIndex({ field1: 1, field2: -1 })  // Drop index on specified fields.
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, carefully monitor the performance of your application.  Use metrics like write operation latency, CPU usage, and the MongoDB profiler to ensure the changes have improved performance. You may need to iterate through steps 1-3, adjusting your index strategy as needed.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes increases the overhead of write operations without necessarily improving read performance.  MongoDB needs to update every index affected by a write. If an index is rarely or never used, it adds unnecessary overhead.  The process of identifying and dropping redundant or unused indexes aims to reduce this overhead and optimize the database for both read and write performance.  A well-designed indexing strategy considers the most frequently used queries and balances read and write performance.
