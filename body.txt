This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB: having too many indexes. While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an excessive number can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead.  This problem falls under the umbrella of MongoDB's Database and Collection management, impacting CRUD operations.

**Description of the Error:**

The "too many indexes" problem doesn't manifest as a specific error message. Instead, you'll observe slow write operations (inserts, updates, deletes), increased storage space consumption, and potentially slower reads if the index overhead outweighs their benefit.  The MongoDB profiler will reveal slow `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations that spend a significant portion of their time on index maintenance.


**Code Example (Illustrative):**

This example demonstrates a scenario where excessive indexes might be created inadvertently.  Suppose you have a collection storing user data:

```javascript
// Hypothetical scenario with many unnecessary indexes
db.users.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { email: 1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { age: 1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { city: 1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { country: 1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { name: 1, age: -1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { email: 1, city: 1 } )
db.users.createIndex( { age: 1, country: -1 } )
// ... many more indexes ...
```

This creates numerous indexes, many of which might be redundant or rarely used.

**Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step:**

1. **Identify Unused Indexes:** Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on a collection. Analyze your query patterns (using the MongoDB profiler or logging) to determine which indexes are frequently used and which are not.

   ```javascript
   db.users.getIndexes()
   ```

2. **Remove Unnecessary Indexes:** Drop indexes that are not utilized or provide minimal performance improvement compared to their cost.

   ```javascript
   db.users.dropIndex( { name: 1, age: -1 } ) //Example: dropping an unused compound index
   db.users.dropIndex("age_1_country_-1") //Example: dropping by index name
   ```


3. **Optimize Existing Indexes:** For frequently used queries, ensure you have optimal indexes. Consider compound indexes to improve the efficiency of queries with multiple filter criteria.  Avoid over-indexing. A good rule of thumb is to have only the indexes you truly need for frequently executed queries.

4. **Monitor Performance:** After removing or optimizing indexes, monitor the write performance using the MongoDB profiler and observe changes in storage space utilization.


**Explanation:**

Each index consumes storage space and adds overhead during write operations.  When inserting or updating a document, MongoDB needs to update all relevant indexes. The more indexes you have, the longer these write operations take.  While indexes speed up reads, the performance gains may be overshadowed by the write performance degradation if too many are present.  The key is to balance the benefits of faster reads with the cost of slower writes.
