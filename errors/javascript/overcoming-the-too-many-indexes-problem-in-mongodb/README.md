# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB stemming from an excessive number of indexes. While indexes are crucial for query optimization, creating too many can lead to significant write performance degradation and increased storage overhead.  This problem often manifests during application scaling or when indexes are added haphazardly without careful consideration.

**Description of the Error:**

The primary symptom of having too many indexes is slow write operations.  `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations will become noticeably slower as MongoDB spends more time maintaining the increased index structures.  You might also observe increased storage usage, slower query performance in some cases (due to index bloat), and potentially even connection timeouts. MongoDB may not explicitly throw an error message indicating "too many indexes," but the performance degradation will be evident. The MongoDB profiler and monitoring tools can help pinpoint this as a source of slowdown.


**Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step:**

This solution focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  We'll assume you're using the MongoDB shell.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

```javascript
db.collectionName.getIndexes()
```

Replace `collectionName` with the name of your collection.  This command returns a list of all indexes on that collection.  Examine the output carefully.  Pay close attention to the `key` field, which shows the indexed fields and their order.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage (using the profiler):**

Enabling the profiler allows you to see which queries are using which indexes (and which aren't). This step is crucial for informed decision-making.

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // enables profiling level 2 (all operations)
```

Run your application for a while to generate profile data. Then review the profile data:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find().sort( { ts: -1 } ).limit(100) // review the last 100 profiling entries
```

Look for queries that are not utilizing indexes (showing a `scanAndOrder` execution type) and investigate why. These might indicate a need for new indexes or optimization of existing ones.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified indexes that aren't being used or are redundant (e.g., indexes covering the same fields in different orders), remove them using the `dropIndex` command:

```javascript
db.collectionName.dropIndex("indexName") // replace indexName with the name of the index to drop
db.collectionName.dropIndex( { fieldName: 1 } ) // Replace fieldName with the field name
```

You can find the `indexName` from the output of `db.collectionName.getIndexes()`.  The second form allows dropping an index based on its key.  Remember to replace `"indexName"` or `{ fieldName: 1 }` with the appropriate index name or key. You can drop multiple indexes at once by providing an array of index specifications.


**Step 4: Re-evaluate Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance using monitoring tools to check if write performance has improved. If the improvement isn't satisfactory, you may need to revisit your indexing strategy.

**Explanation:**

The core idea is to maintain a balance between query performance and write performance.  Too many indexes lead to increased write overhead because MongoDB has to update all indexes every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted. By carefully identifying and removing unused or redundant indexes, you reduce this overhead, improving write performance and storage efficiency.  Always use the profiler to understand actual query behavior before adding or removing indexes.
