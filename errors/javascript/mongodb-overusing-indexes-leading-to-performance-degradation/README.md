# üêû MongoDB: Overusing Indexes Leading to Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly improve query performance, creating too many or incorrectly designed indexes can lead to performance bottlenecks, increased storage consumption, and slower write operations.  This happens because each index adds overhead during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) as the database needs to update all relevant indexes.  When there are many indexes, this overhead becomes substantial, outweighing the benefits of improved read performance.  Furthermore, poorly chosen indexes may not be utilized effectively by queries, leading to wasted space and resources.


## Code Example (Illustrative -  Error and Fix)


Let's assume we have a collection named "products" with fields `name`, `category`, `price`, and `description`.  We are frequently querying by `category` and sometimes by `name`.  A naive approach might be to create indexes for both fields individually and possibly a compound index for both:

**Problem: Overindexing**

```javascript
// Incorrect - Overindexing
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, name: 1 } ) // Compound Index, but maybe not needed

//  (Further queries in the application using these indexes)
```


**Solution: Optimized Indexing Strategy**

Instead, a more efficient strategy might involve a single compound index, ordered based on query frequency and selectivity. If queries for `category` are far more frequent than for `name`, this is ideal:

```javascript
// Correct - Optimized Indexing
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, name: 1 } ) // Compound index, improves both category-only and combined queries
db.products.dropIndex("name_1") // Remove redundant index on name alone
db.products.dropIndex("category_1") // Remove redundant index on category alone
```

**Explanation of the fix:** The optimized strategy combines the criteria into a single, compound index.  MongoDB can efficiently use the leading field (`category`) for queries filtering by category alone. The inclusion of `name` in the compound index also handles queries that specify both `category` and `name`.  Dropping the redundant single-field indexes reduces write overhead considerably without impacting read performance for the common `category` queries.


## Explanation

Over-indexing negatively affects write performance because every write operation requires updating all indexes. This impact increases proportionally with the number of indexes.  The benefits of fast reads are overshadowed by slow writes when over-indexing is present. The ideal indexing strategy involves carefully considering query patterns, data selectivity, and the trade-off between read and write performance. Using the `explain()` method on your queries helps analyze query execution and identify which indexes are used and their performance.
