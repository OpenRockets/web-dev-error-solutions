## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB, especially in larger applications, is having too many indexes. While indexes are crucial for query performance, an excessive number can severely impact write performance and storage space.  This happens because every write operation must update all affected indexes, adding significant overhead.  The symptom is often slow write operations and increased database size, even with relatively small datasets. MongoDB may also log warnings about excessive index usage.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and reduce excessive indexes using the MongoDB shell and compass.  We'll assume a collection named `products` with potentially too many indexes.

**Step 1: Identifying Excessive Indexes**

First, use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection.

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array of all indexes.  Look for indexes that are rarely used or redundant.  Consider:

* **Redundant indexes:**  Indexes covering the same fields in the same order are redundant.
* **Unnecessary indexes:** Indexes on fields rarely used in queries.
* **Over-indexed fields:** If a query already uses a compound index (an index on multiple fields), indexes on individual fields within that compound index might be unnecessary.

**Step 2: Analyzing Index Usage (using Compass)**

MongoDB Compass provides a visual representation of index usage.  Open your database in Compass, select the `products` collection, and navigate to the "Indexes" tab.  Here, you'll find information about each index, including its usage statistics. This can help pinpoint underutilized indexes.

**Step 3: Removing Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes to remove, use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method. Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to remove. You can find the index name from the output of `db.collection.getIndexes()`.  For example:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("my_unnecessary_index_name_1");
db.products.dropIndex("my_unnecessary_index_name_2");
```

Alternatively, you can drop an index by specifying the index keys:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({field1: 1, field2: -1}); //drops the index on field1 (ascending) and field2 (descending)
```

**Step 4: Monitoring Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your write and query performance. Use MongoDB's profiling tools or performance monitoring dashboards to assess the impact of the changes.  You might need to iterate, removing indexes one at a time and observing the impact.

## Explanation

Having too many indexes increases write operations overhead because each write operation requires updating all indexes. It also leads to increased storage space usage as indexes themselves consume space.  Therefore, it's crucial to create only necessary indexes to optimize for both read and write performance.
