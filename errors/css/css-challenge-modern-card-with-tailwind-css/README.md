# üêû CSS Challenge:  Modern Card with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a modern-looking product card using Tailwind CSS. The card will feature an image, title, description, and a call-to-action button. We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient and responsive styling.


## Description of the Styling

The card will have a clean and minimalist design.  It will be responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes. The image will be displayed prominently at the top, followed by the title, a short description, and a button to encourage user interaction.  We'll use a subtle shadow and rounded corners to give it a modern feel.  The color palette will be neutral and easy on the eyes.
