[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using Tailwind CSS.  We'll achieve this through clever use of shadows, transforms, and hover effects.  The card will contain an image and some text.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will have a clean, modern look.  It will be slightly elevated from the background using a box shadow. On hover, the card will subtly scale up and the shadow will become more pronounced, giving a 3D \"lift\" effect.  The image within the card will be rounded at the corners.  Tailwind's utility classes will make this styling concise and efficient.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>3D Card with Tailwind CSS</title>\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n  <div class=\"container mx-auto p-8\">\n    <div class=\"max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md shadow-gray-400 hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105 transition duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n      <img class=\"rounded-t-lg w-full h-48 object-cover\" src=\"https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x400\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n      <div class=\"p-4\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\">Card Title</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n          This is a sample card description.
