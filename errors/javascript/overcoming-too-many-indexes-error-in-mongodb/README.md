# üêû Overcoming "Too Many Indexes" Error in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

The "too many indexes" error in MongoDB isn't a specific error message thrown by the MongoDB driver or shell. Instead, it represents a performance degradation and potential issues arising from having an excessive number of indexes on a collection.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization,  too many can severely impact write performance, increase storage space, and ultimately hinder application speed.  This happens because each write operation requires updating all relevant indexes, and a large number of indexes dramatically increases this overhead.  The symptoms are typically slow write operations, increased storage usage, and potentially even a noticeable slow down of read operations despite the presence of indexes.

## Fixing Steps (Step-by-Step Code)

This example demonstrates how to identify and address excessive indexes in a MongoDB collection named "products" within a database named "mydatabase".

**Step 1: Identify Over-Indexed Collections:**

First, we need to identify which collections are burdened with too many indexes. Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes for a specific collection:

```javascript
use mydatabase;
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This command will return a list of all indexes associated with the `products` collection, including their keys and other properties. Analyze the output to assess if the number of indexes is excessive relative to the query patterns used against the collection.  Consider the frequency and selectivity of queries.  Indexes used infrequently are candidates for removal.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage (Optional but Recommended):**

For deeper analysis, use the MongoDB profiler (requires enabling profiling at a database or collection level). The profiler records database operations, including which indexes were used for queries.  This allows for informed decisions about which indexes are truly necessary.  To enable profiling:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // 2 enables profiling for all operations
```

Run some typical queries against the `products` collection.  Then, review the profiling logs:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find().sort({$natural:-1})
```


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified indexes that are not actively contributing to query performance or are redundant, you can remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method. For example, to remove an index with the key `{"sku": 1}`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"sku": 1});
```

Remember to replace `"sku": 1` with the actual key of the index you want to drop.

**Step 4: Monitor Performance After Changes:**

After removing indexes, closely monitor the write performance and overall database performance using monitoring tools provided by MongoDB or external monitoring systems.   You should observe improvements in write speeds.


## Explanation

The core issue is a balance between query optimization (achieved through indexes) and write performance (impeded by numerous indexes).  Every index adds overhead to write operations. While indexes significantly speed up reads, the added burden on writes becomes unsustainable beyond a certain point.  Profiling helps identify underutilized indexes. By strategically removing unnecessary or redundant indexes, we improve write operations without sacrificing read performance for essential queries.  This process requires careful planning and understanding of your application‚Äôs query patterns.
