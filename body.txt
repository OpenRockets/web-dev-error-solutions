## Description of the Error

The "Index Not Found" error in MongoDB occurs when a query attempts to utilize an index that doesn't exist. This usually leads to significantly slower query performance because MongoDB resorts to a collection scan, examining every document in the collection. This is especially problematic with large collections.  The error message might not always be explicitly "Index Not Found," but rather manifest as unexpectedly slow queries or timeout errors, especially when dealing with large datasets.


## Scenario: Slow Queries Due to Missing Index

Let's assume we have a collection called `users` with documents containing a `username` field (string) and an `age` field (integer). We frequently query for users based on their username.  Without an index on `username`, these queries will be slow.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates using the MongoDB shell.  You can adapt it to your preferred driver (e.g., Python, Node.js).

**Step 1: Connect to your MongoDB instance.**

```bash
mongo
```

**Step 2: Access the `users` database and collection.**

```javascript
use users
db.users.find({}) //verify collection exists
```

**Step 3: Create the missing index.**

This command creates a single-field index on the `username` field. The `unique: true` option ensures that usernames are unique (optional, depending on your requirements).

```javascript
db.users.createIndex( { username: 1 }, { unique: true } )
```

**Step 4: Verify the index was created.**

```javascript
db.users.getIndexes()
```

This will list all indexes for the `users` collection, including the newly created index on `username`.  You should see an output similar to:

```json
[
	{
		"v" : 2,
		"key" : {
			"_id" : 1
		},
		"name" : "_id_",
		"ns" : "users.users"
	},
	{
		"v" : 2,
		"key" : {
			"username" : 1
		},
		"name" : "username_1",
		"unique" : true,
		"ns" : "users.users"
	}
]
```

**Step 5: Re-run your query.**

Now, re-run your query that previously suffered from slow performance. You should notice a significant improvement in query speed. For example:

```javascript
db.users.find({ username: "johnDoe" })
```


## Explanation

The `createIndex()` method creates a B-tree index on the specified field(s).  This index allows MongoDB to efficiently locate documents matching specific criteria without having to scan the entire collection. The `unique: true` option enforces uniqueness on the indexed field (in this case, the username), preventing duplicate usernames.  If you don't specify `unique: true` and attempt to insert a duplicate username, MongoDB will throw an error.  Choosing the right index type (e.g., hashed, geospatial) depends on your query patterns and data types.
