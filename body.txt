## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB, especially in larger deployments, is having too many indexes. While indexes dramatically speed up queries, excessive indexing can lead to performance degradation due to increased write operations overhead.  Write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) become slower as MongoDB must update all affected indexes.  Additionally, excessive indexes consume significant disk space.  MongoDB can become slow and unresponsive, and you might encounter errors indirectly related to this, such as slow query performance or even out-of-memory exceptions.  The symptom isn't always a clear "too many indexes" error message, but rather a general performance bottleneck impacting both read and write operations.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates analyzing index usage and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named `products`. Replace `"your_database"` and `"products"` with your actual database and collection names.

**Step 1: Identify Underutilized Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.stats()` command to get statistics on your collection, including index information.  Focus on the `indexSizes` field, which shows the size of each index, and indirectly hints at usage frequency.  Frequently used indexes usually have a larger size due to more data being indexed within that collection. Indexes with significantly smaller sizes are candidates for removal.

```bash
use your_database;
db.products.stats();
```

**Step 2: Analyze Query Performance with `db.collection.explain()`**

This command is crucial.  It reveals the execution plan for a query, showing which indexes are used (or not used).  Run your most common queries (especially slow ones) with `explain()`. Look for queries that don't use an index (indicated by "COLLSCAN" in the execution plan). This might show that a specific index is unnecessary if the query isn't using it despite seemingly relevant fields.

```javascript
db.products.find( { price: { $gt: 100 } } ).explain();
```

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once identified, remove indexes using `db.collection.dropIndex()`.  Always back up your database before making such changes.

```javascript
// Example: Removing an index on the 'category' field
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1 } );

// Example: Removing a compound index
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1, price: -1 } );

//Example: Remove all indexes except _id.  USE WITH CAUTION!
db.products.dropIndexes() //Removes all indexes except _id
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance After Removal**

After removing indexes, monitor your database performance using monitoring tools or by running the same queries again with `explain()`.  You should observe improved write performance and potentially improved read performance if the removed indexes were indeed unnecessary.


## Explanation

The key to efficient indexing is to strike a balance. Too few indexes lead to slow queries, while too many indexes result in slow writes and increased storage needs. Analyzing index usage through `db.collection.stats()` and `db.collection.explain()` allows for data-driven decisions about which indexes to keep and which to remove.  Prioritize indexes on frequently queried fields, especially those used in `$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, etc.  Compound indexes can further optimize queries involving multiple fields. Always remove indexes incrementally and monitor the effects to avoid unexpected consequences.
