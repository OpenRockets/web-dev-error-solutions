[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card with a subtle 3D effect using Tailwind CSS.  The card will feature a background image, title, and description, all styled to give the impression of depth and dimension.  We'll achieve this using shadows, gradients, and careful positioning of elements.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a slightly raised appearance due to a box shadow.  A subtle gradient will be applied to the background to add visual interest. The title will be prominently displayed, while the description will be slightly indented and styled for readability.  The overall effect should be clean, modern, and subtly three-dimensional.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"w-96 bg-gray-100 shadow-lg rounded-lg overflow-hidden\">\n  <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542831371-29b0f74f9713?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTJ8fGNhcmR8ZW58MHx8MHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60\" alt=\"Card Image\" class=\"w-full h-64 object-cover\">\n  <div class=\"p-6\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2\">Card Title</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-base\">\n      This is a sample description for the card.  It should be relatively short and to the point.  You can add more text here if needed.  It's all about demonstrating the styling capabilities of Tailwind CSS.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`w-96`**: Sets the width of the card to 96 units (Tailwind's default unit is usually 4px, so this is 384px).\n* **`bg-gray-100`**: Sets the background color to a light gray.\n* **`shadow-lg`**: Applies a large box shadow, giving the card a raised appearance.\n* **`rounded-lg`**: Adds rounded corners to the card.\n* **`overflow-hidden`**: Prevents content from overflowing the card's boundaries.\n* **`object-cover`**: Ensures the image covers the entire container.\n* **`p-6`**: Adds padding of 6 units (24px) to the content area.\n* **`text-2xl`**: Sets the title font size to extra large.\n* **`font-bold`**: Makes the title bold.\n* **`text-gray-900`**: Sets the title color to a dark gray.\n* **`mb-2`**: Adds a bottom margin of 2 units (8px) to the title.\n* **`text-gray-700`**: Sets the description color to a medium gray.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  This is the official documentation for Tailwind CSS.  It's an excellent resource for learning about all the utility classes available.\n* **Understanding CSS Box Shadow:** [Search for \"CSS box-shadow\" on MDN Web Docs or similar sites](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) Understanding box-shadow is crucial for creating the 3D effect.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
