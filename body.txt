## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries, excessive indexing can hinder performance.  Creating too many indexes increases the write overhead (as indexes need updating on every write operation) and consumes significant disk space. This can lead to slower insert, update, and delete operations, ultimately negating the benefits of indexing.  The slowdown is particularly noticeable on high-write workloads.  The database can become I/O bound, leading to sluggish application response times and potential application instability.  Furthermore, poorly chosen indexes can also lead to performance issues even if the number of indexes isn't excessively high.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with the following schema:

```json
{
  "name": "Product A",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 99.99,
  "description": "A great product",
  "tags": ["electronics", "gadget", "new"]
}
```

And let's say we've created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and `tags` individually:

```javascript
// Incorrectly over-indexed collection
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { "tags": 1 } )
```

This is excessive. We need to strategically choose which indexes are truly necessary.  Let's assume the most frequent queries are for products by category and products within a specific price range. In this case, a compound index would be more efficient than individual indexes:


```javascript
// Step 1: Drop unnecessary indexes
db.products.dropIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { "tags": 1 } )


// Step 2: Create a compound index for frequent queries
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )

// Step 3 (Optional but recommended): Create a single index on tags if tag-based searches are frequent
db.products.createIndex( { "tags": 1 } ) // If tag-based search is really frequent


//Step 4 (Optional): Analyze query patterns to further refine indexing strategy.

// use the db.products.aggregate([{$project:{_id:0, name:1, category:1}}]) 
// to check how your schema is like to facilitate easier index creation based on queries. 
```

## Explanation

By dropping the unnecessary indexes (`name` in this example) and creating a compound index on `category` and `price`, we improve performance significantly.  A compound index allows MongoDB to efficiently handle queries that filter by both `category` and `price`.  This single index replaces the need for two separate indexes, reducing write overhead and disk space usage.

The optional step of indexing `tags` is dependent on the query patterns. If frequently querying by tags, it might be beneficial. However, the complexity of this field (being an array) may affect indexing efficiency. Analyzing your query workload is crucial for optimizing indexing strategies.

Always analyze your application's query patterns using MongoDB profiling tools (available through the `db.getProfilingStatus()` and `db.setProfilingLevel()` commands and the MongoDB Compass GUI) to identify which fields are frequently used in queries. This data-driven approach will help you create the most efficient indexing strategy.
