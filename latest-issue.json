[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on creating a visually appealing card component using CSS.  We'll use plain CSS (no preprocessors or frameworks like Tailwind) to achieve this, emphasizing fundamental CSS concepts like box-model, flexbox, and selectors. The goal is to build a clean, responsive card suitable for displaying information like product details, blog posts, or user profiles.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling:\n\nThe card will have the following features:\n\n* **Rounded corners:**  A subtle rounded border for a softer look.\n* **Shadow:** A subtle box-shadow to give it depth and separation from the background.\n* **Padding:** Internal padding to create comfortable spacing around the content.\n* **Clear Typography:**  A heading and paragraph of text styled consistently.\n* **Responsive Design:** The card should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.\n\n\n\n## Full Code:\n\n```css\n.card {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  width: 300px; /* Adjust as needed */\n  margin: 20px auto; /* Center the card */\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0; /* Remove default top margin */\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.card p {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  color: #555;\n}\n\n/* Responsive adjustments (example) */\n@media (max-width: 400px) {\n  .card {\n    width: 90%; /* Make card take up most of the screen width */\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nTo use this CSS, you would need corresponding HTML structure, for example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CSS Card</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <h2>My Awesome Card</h2>\n    <p>This is a sample paragraph demonstrating the card component. You can add more content here as needed. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation:\n\n* **`.card`:** This selector styles the main card container.  `background-color`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `padding` are used to create the visual appearance.  `width` and `margin` control the card's size and positioning.\n* **`.card h2` and `.card p`:** These selectors target the heading and paragraph elements *within* the card, allowing for specific styling of the text.  `margin-top` is removed from the heading to avoid excess spacing.\n* **`@media (max-width: 400px)`:** This media query applies styles specifically for screens smaller than 400px wide.  In this example, it makes the card occupy 90% of the available width.  You can adjust the breakpoint and styles as needed for better responsiveness.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More:\n\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Comprehensive documentation on all things CSS.\n* **CSS-Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) - A great resource for CSS tutorials and articles.\n* **FreeCodeCamp (CSS):** [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Offers interactive CSS learning paths.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
