# 🐞 Overcoming the "too many indexes" problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter in MongoDB: performance degradation due to an excessive number of indexes.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, having too many can lead to slower write operations and increased storage overhead.  This problem falls under the umbrella of MongoDB Databases and Indexes.

## Description of the Error

When you have numerous indexes on a collection, MongoDB spends significant time maintaining them. Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all applicable indexes.  If you have many indexes, especially compound indexes (indexes on multiple fields), this update process becomes a bottleneck.  The symptoms include:

* **Slow write operations:** Inserts, updates, and deletes become noticeably slower.
* **Increased storage usage:** Indexes consume storage space. Too many indexes lead to significantly larger database sizes.
* **Performance degradation on write-heavy workloads:** The write performance bottleneck impacts the overall application performance.
* **Potential for index bloat:**  If indexes are not used efficiently (e.g., rarely used indexes), they become an unnecessary overhead.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

The solution involves identifying and removing unnecessary indexes. This requires careful analysis of your application's query patterns.  We'll illustrate this with a hypothetical scenario:

Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with fields like `name`, `category`, `price`, `description`, and `tags`.  We've created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and `name` + `category`.

**Step 1: Analyze Query Logs and Slow Queries**

The first step is to identify which indexes are frequently used and which are not. MongoDB's profiling features or monitoring tools can help. Look for slow queries and identify the indexes they utilize.  You can enable profiling using the `db.setProfilingLevel()` command.

**Step 2: Examine `db.collection.stats()`**

Run `db.products.stats()` (replace `products` with your collection name) to get statistics on your collection, including index information. Pay attention to the `indexSizes` which show the size of each index. This helps identify large, potentially underutilized indexes.

**Step 3: Identify Unused or Redundant Indexes**

Review your application's queries and identify indexes that are never or rarely used. Also, check for redundancy. If an index on `name` and another on `name` and `category` exists, the combined index potentially covers the single `name` index, making it redundant.

**Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you identify unnecessary indexes, use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove them.  For example, if you determine the index on `price` is unused:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("price_1") // Replace "price_1" with the actual index name from db.products.getIndexes()
```

You can find index names using:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, carefully monitor your write performance. Use tools like MongoDB Compass or your application's monitoring system to track write latency and overall database performance.


## Full Code Example (Illustrative)

This example demonstrates identifying and removing an index.  **Remember to adapt this to your specific collection and index names.**


```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB database (replace with your connection string)
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"; // Replace with your connection string
const client = new MongoClient(uri);

async function removeIndex() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    const database = client.db("your_database_name"); // Replace with your database name
    const collection = database.collection("products"); // Replace with your collection name

    // Get index information
    const indexes = await collection.getIndexes();
    console.log("Existing indexes:", indexes);


    //Find an index to drop (replace with your index key).  Look at the output of getIndexes() to find the appropriate name!
    const indexToRemove = indexes.find(index => index.name === "price_1"); //Replace with the exact index name you wish to remove


    if (indexToRemove) {
      const result = await collection.dropIndex(indexToRemove.name);
      console.log("Index dropped:", result);
    } else {
      console.log("Index not found");
    }

  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

removeIndex().catch(console.dir);
```


## Explanation

The key to solving the "too many indexes" problem is a strategic approach involving identifying which indexes are beneficial and eliminating those that negatively impact write performance without significantly affecting read performance.  Regularly reviewing and optimizing your indexes is a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy and efficient MongoDB database.
