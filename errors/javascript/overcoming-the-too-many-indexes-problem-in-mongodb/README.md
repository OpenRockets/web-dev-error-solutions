# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB development is creating too many indexes. While indexes drastically improve query performance, an excessive number can severely hinder write operations and overall database performance.  This happens because every write operation must update all affected indexes, increasing write latency and potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.  The symptom is often slow write speeds, high write latency, and potentially even system instability.  MongoDB may also log warnings about slow index updates.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection named "products".  We'll assume you're using the MongoDB shell.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

First, we need to list all indexes on the "products" collection and analyze their usage.  We can use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method:

```javascript
use mydatabase; // Replace mydatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of index specifications, including the index name and the fields involved.  Analyze the output.  Look for indexes that:

* **Are rarely used:** Indexes not used in frequent queries are candidates for removal. You can use MongoDB's profiler (explained below) to determine index usage.
* **Are redundant:** If multiple indexes cover the same query patterns, keep the most efficient one and remove the others.
* **Are too broad:** Compound indexes including many fields can be less efficient if only a subset of those fields is frequently queried.


**Step 2: Profiling to Analyze Index Usage (Optional but Recommended)**

To get a clearer picture of index usage, enable the MongoDB profiler:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enables slow queries profiling
```

Run your application for some time to generate profiling data. Then, retrieve the profiling data:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:100}}).sort({ts:-1})
```

This query shows all queries taking longer than 100ms.  Examine the `scanAndOrder` and `ixscan` entries.  `ixscan` indicates index usage.  If you see queries frequently performing `scanAndOrder` (a full collection scan) instead of `ixscan`, it may indicate the need for a specific index or that existing indexes are insufficient.  Disable profiling afterward to avoid performance overhead:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```


**Step 3: Removing Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified redundant or unused indexes, remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to drop. You can get the index name from the output of `db.collection.getIndexes()`.

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For example, to drop an index named "idx_product_name_price":

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("idx_product_name_price")
```

**Step 4:  Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's write performance.  You might use tools like MongoDB Compass or your application's logging to track write times and identify further improvements.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes increases the overhead of write operations.  Every write needs to update all indexes, leading to increased latency and resource consumption.  Identifying and dropping unused or redundant indexes reduces this overhead, boosting write performance and overall database efficiency. Profiling helps pinpoint queries that are not benefiting from indexes, allowing for more targeted index creation or optimization.
