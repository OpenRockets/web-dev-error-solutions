## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is overusing indexes. While indexes dramatically speed up query performance, creating too many or inappropriately designed indexes can actually hurt performance.  This occurs because:

* **Write Operations Slow Down:** Every write operation (insert, update, delete) must update all relevant indexes.  Excessive indexes increase write times significantly.
* **Increased Storage Space:** Indexes consume disk space.  Too many indexes lead to higher storage costs and slower data retrieval due to increased I/O.
* **Index Fragmentation:**  Frequent updates can lead to index fragmentation, further slowing down query performance.


## Fixing Step-by-Step (Illustrative Example)

Let's imagine a collection called `products` with fields `name` (string), `category` (string), `price` (number), and `description` (string).  A developer, anticipating various queries, creates indexes on every single field individually:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { description: 1 } )
```

This is excessive.  A better approach involves strategically choosing indexes based on frequently executed queries.  Let's assume most queries filter by `category` and then sort by `price`.  We should then have a compound index:

**Step 1: Identify Frequently Used Queries:**

Analyze your application logs and identify the most common queries against the `products` collection.

**Step 2: Create Optimized Indexes:**

Remove the individual indexes and create a compound index covering the fields used in the most frequent queries:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("name_1")  //Remove existing index
db.products.dropIndex("category_1") //Remove existing index
db.products.dropIndex("price_1")  //Remove existing index
db.products.dropIndex("description_1") //Remove existing index

db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } ) // Compound Index
```

This compound index efficiently supports queries that filter by `category` and sort by `price`.  The order of fields in the index matters â€“ it reflects the query order for optimization.

**Step 3: Monitor Performance:**

After creating the optimized index, monitor the query performance using MongoDB's profiling tools (e.g., `db.system.profile`).  Observe the execution times of your queries and compare them to the previous performance.

**Step 4: Iterate and Refine:**

Based on performance monitoring, further optimize your index strategy.  You might need to add additional indexes if other queries are still slow, but always prioritize the most frequent and performance-critical queries.


## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to performance degradation because of the increased overhead on write operations.  Every write operation needs to update all existing indexes.  The cost of this updating outweighs the benefit of faster reads if the indexes are rarely used.  A well-chosen, smaller number of compound indexes usually yields the best results.  Always analyze query patterns to build the most efficient index strategy for your application.
