# üêû CSS Challenge: Responsive Multi-Column Card Layout


This challenge focuses on creating a responsive layout of cards using CSS Grid or Flexbox. The goal is to achieve a multi-column layout that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, maintaining a clean and visually appealing arrangement.  We'll use CSS Grid for this example, but a Flexbox solution is equally valid.


## Styling Description

The layout should feature several cards arranged in a grid.  On larger screens (desktops), the cards should be displayed in a 3-column grid. As the screen size decreases (tablets and mobile), the grid should adjust to 2 columns, and finally, to a single column on the smallest screens. Each card will have a consistent size and will contain an image, a title, and a short description.

  <div class="card">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x150" alt="Card Image 5">

## Explanation

The key to the responsive layout is the use of `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));` within the `.card-container` class.

* `repeat(auto-fit, ...)`: This tells the grid to create as many columns as will fit within the container's width.
* `minmax(250px, 1fr)`: This defines the minimum and maximum width of each column.  `250px` ensures each card has a minimum width, while `1fr` allows the columns to share the available space equally.

This combination allows the grid to automatically adjust the number of columns based on the available screen width, resulting in a responsive layout.
