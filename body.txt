## Description of the Error

Overusing MongoDB indexes, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage space consumption.  Each index adds overhead during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because MongoDB needs to update the index alongside the data.  If you have too many indexes, especially on frequently updated fields, the write performance can become severely impacted, outweighing any query performance gains.  Excessive indexing can also lead to substantial storage bloat.

## Code Example: Fixing Over-Indexing

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  Assume we have a collection named `products` with several indexes, some of which are underutilized.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

We can use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all existing indexes and analyze their usage.  This often requires monitoring your application's queries to identify frequently used indexes. Tools like MongoDB Compass can help visualize index usage.

```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB database
use your_database_name;

// Select the collection
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This will return a JSON array showing all indexes on the `products` collection.  Examine the `key` field to see which fields are indexed and consider their usage frequency.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Let's say after analysis, we determine the index `{"name": 1, "category": 1}` and `{"description": 1}` are rarely used. We can remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method:

```javascript
// Remove the index on 'name' and 'category'
db.products.dropIndex({"name": 1, "category": 1});

// Remove the index on 'description'
db.products.dropIndex({"description": 1});
```

**Step 3: Verify Index Removal**

After dropping the indexes, re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm they've been removed.


## Explanation

The core issue is a balance between read and write performance.  Indexes speed up reads by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate documents based on specified fields. However, each index requires extra storage and adds overhead to write operations.  If the cost of maintaining an index (write slowdown, storage overhead) surpasses its benefit (read speedup), then that index is counterproductive.  The key is strategic indexing: only index fields frequently used in queries where the performance benefit significantly outweighs the cost.
