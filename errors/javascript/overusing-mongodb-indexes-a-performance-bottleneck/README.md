# üêû Overusing MongoDB Indexes: A Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

One common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries, excessive indexing can severely hinder write performance and database size.  Every index added consumes disk space and requires updates whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This overhead can outweigh the benefits of faster queries, especially in write-heavy applications.  Symptoms include slow insertion/update speeds, increased database size, and overall performance degradation.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields `name`, `category`, `price`, and `description`.  We initially created indexes on all four fields, significantly slowing down write operations.

**Step 1: Identify Underutilized Indexes**

First, use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all existing indexes:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of indexes. Analyze the query logs (using MongoDB's profiling tools or monitoring solutions) to see which indexes are actually used frequently and which are rarely or never used.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified underutilized indexes, drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  For example, if the `description` field's index is unused:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("description_1")
```

Replace `"description_1"` with the actual index name from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`. If you have a compound index involving `description`,  you'll need to use the complete index name as returned by `getIndexes()`.

**Step 3: Optimize Existing Indexes**

Review your remaining indexes. Consider these points:

* **Specificity:** Are your indexes too broad? A single field index on `category` might be fine, but if you often query based on `category` and `price` together, a compound index `{"category": 1, "price": 1}` would be more efficient.
* **Compound Indexes:** For frequently used queries involving multiple fields, create compound indexes. The order of fields matters; put the most frequently filtered field first.
* **Index Types:** Consider using different index types like hashed indexes for improved speed in certain scenarios (e.g., equality searches).


**Example of creating a compound index:**

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing or optimizing indexes, monitor your database's performance using MongoDB's monitoring tools (e.g., MongoDB Compass, the `db.serverStatus()` command) or external monitoring systems.  Track write operations and storage usage to ensure your changes have improved performance.

## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to slower write performance because every index needs to be updated on write operations (insert, update, delete). This overhead can drastically impact the speed of your application if the benefits of faster read speeds are not outweighing the increased write overhead.  By strategically choosing indexes only for frequently used queries, you maintain fast read operations while avoiding the performance penalties associated with unnecessary indexes.  The key is to find a balance between read and write performance.
