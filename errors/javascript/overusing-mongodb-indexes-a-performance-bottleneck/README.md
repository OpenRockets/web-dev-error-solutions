# üêû Overusing MongoDB Indexes: A Performance Bottleneck


## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead without providing proportional read performance improvements.  While indexes are crucial for efficient query operations, creating too many or overly broad indexes can lead to substantial performance issues.  Writes become slower because every write operation must update all relevant indexes.  Storage space is consumed by the index data itself, which can be substantial for large collections.  Finally,  the performance gains from indexing might be negligible or even overshadowed by the overhead introduced, especially with frequent writes or updates.  The most noticeable effect is usually slower write times.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields `name` (string), `category` (string), `price` (number), `description` (string), and `inStock` (boolean).  We initially created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and a compound index on `category` and `price`.  We notice slow write performance.

**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns**

Before making any changes, we must analyze our application's query patterns to identify which indexes are actually necessary and which are underutilized.  MongoDB's profiling tools are essential here.  We can enable profiling (temporarily for testing) to see which queries are slow and the indexes used (or not used).

```javascript
// Enable profiling level 2 (log all queries)
db.setProfilingLevel(2)

// Perform typical queries against the collection
// ... your queries here ...

// Retrieve profiling data
db.system.profile.find()
```

**Step 2: Review Index Usage**

Examine the profiling data.  Look for queries that don't utilize indexes efficiently or queries that are slow despite having relevant indexes.  This may indicate poor index design or unnecessary indexes.  We'll find the most frequent queries. Let's assume most queries filter by `category` or use the compound index on `category` and `price`. Queries on `name` and `price` individually are rare.

**Step 3: Remove Redundant or Unused Indexes**

Based on our analysis, let's remove indexes on `name` and `price` individually as they aren't heavily used:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("name_1")  // Drop the index on 'name'
db.products.dropIndex("price_1") // Drop the index on 'price'
```

**Step 4: Optimize Existing Indexes (if necessary)**

If a compound index is too broad (includes fields that are rarely used in query filters), consider creating more specific indexes instead.  If this were the case, we would need to evaluate the usage of our compound index (`category_1_price_1`). For the sake of this example, we will leave it as it seems to be used.


**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor write performance using MongoDB's monitoring tools or application-level metrics.  You should observe a significant improvement in write speed.

## Explanation

Over-indexing leads to write performance degradation because MongoDB must update every relevant index whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This can lead to I/O bottlenecks and slow response times.   Removing unnecessary indexes reduces the number of indexes that need updating, resulting in faster write operations.  Analyzing query patterns helps identify indexes that provide the greatest benefit, allowing us to focus on optimizing only the most frequently used queries.
