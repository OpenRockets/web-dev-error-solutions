## Description of the Error

The "too many indexes" problem in MongoDB arises when a collection has an excessive number of indexes.  This doesn't necessarily mean you have *too many* in an absolute sense, but rather that the number is exceeding the optimal balance between query performance and write performance.  Having too many indexes leads to several issues:

* **Slower write operations:** Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all indexes.  More indexes mean more overhead, resulting in significantly slower write performance.
* **Increased storage space:** Each index consumes storage space.  Excessive indexes lead to increased storage costs and potentially impact overall database performance.
* **Complex index management:** Maintaining a large number of indexes becomes challenging, increasing the complexity of database administration and potentially leading to errors.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary compound indexes.  Let's say we have a collection called `products` with several compound indexes that are no longer needed after a schema change.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use mydatabase;
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array of all indexes. Examine the output carefully. Look for indexes that are:

* **Redundant:**  Do multiple indexes cover essentially the same query patterns?
* **Unused:** Are there indexes that haven't been used in a significant period? You can use MongoDB monitoring tools to check index usage.
* **Inefficient:** Are there indexes that are too broad or too specific for your typical queries?

Let's assume we identify two redundant indexes: `{ category: 1, price: 1 }` and `{ category: 1, price: -1 }`. They differ only in sort order, and likely one is sufficient.

**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.products.dropIndex()` command to remove the redundant indexes:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1, price: -1 } )
```

Verify the removal by running `db.products.getIndexes()` again.

**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, closely monitor your write and read performance. Use MongoDB monitoring tools (like the MongoDB Atlas monitoring dashboards or the `db.currentOp()` command) to check if the changes have improved performance.

**Step 4: Optimize Remaining Indexes**

Review your remaining indexes. Can you consolidate any further? Could you use a more efficient index design for your most frequent queries?  Consider using covered queries to minimize the amount of data MongoDB needs to retrieve.


## Explanation

The key is to strike a balance between query speed and write speed. Every index improves query performance for specific queries but degrades write performance.  Identifying and removing underused or redundant indexes reduces the overhead of write operations, improves storage efficiency, and simplifies database management.  Proper index design and regular review are crucial for maintaining optimal MongoDB performance.
