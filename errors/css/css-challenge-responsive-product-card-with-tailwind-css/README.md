* **Image:** A prominent product image taking up a significant portion of the card.
* **Title:** A concise and descriptive product title.
* **Description:** A brief overview of the product's features or benefits.
* **Price:** Clearly displayed product price.
* **Button:** A call-to-action button (e.g., "Add to Cart").

## Explanation

The code utilizes Tailwind CSS classes to style the product card.  `max-w-sm` limits the card's width, `bg-white` sets the background color, `rounded-lg` adds rounded corners, and `shadow-md` provides a subtle shadow.  The image uses `object-cover` to ensure it fills the container.  The text elements are styled using classes like `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, and `text-gray-900` for size, weight, and color.  The button employs classes to create a visually appealing call to action.  The responsive nature is largely handled by Tailwind's built-in responsive modifiers (not explicitly shown in this simple example,  but you can add `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc. prefixes to classes for different breakpoints).
